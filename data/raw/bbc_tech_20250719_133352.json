    "content": "US passes first major national crypto legislation1 day agoShareSaveNatalie ShermanBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesLawmakers in the US have passed the country's first major national cryptocurrency legislation.It is a major milestone for the once fringe industry, which has been lobbying Congress over regulation for years and poured millions into last year's election, backing candidates that included Donald Trump. The bill sets up a regulatory regime for so-called stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency backed by assets seen as reliable, such as the dollar. Trump is expected to sign the legislation into law on Friday, after the House passed the bill on Thursday, joining the Senate, which had approved the measure last month.Known as the Genius Act, the bill is one of three pieces of cryptocurrency legislation advancing in Washington that is backed by Trump.The president once derided crypto as a scam but his opinion shifted as he won backing from the sector and got involved in the industry as a businessman, with ties to firms such as World Liberty Financial.Supporters of the legislation say it is aimed at providing clear rules for a growing industry, ensuring the US keeps pace with advances in payment systems. The crypto industry had been pushing for such measures in hopes it could spur more people to use digital currency and bring it more into the mainstream. The provisions include requiring stablecoins, an alternate cryptocurrency to the likes of Bitcoin, to be backed one-for-one with US dollars, or other low-risk assets. Stablecoins are used by traders to move funds between different crypto tokens. The use of these coins, which are viewed as less volatile, has grown rapidly in recent years. From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they meanCritics argue the bill will introduce new risks into the financial system, by legitimising stablecoins without erecting sufficient protections for consumers. For example, they said it would deepen tech firms' participation in bank-like activities without subjecting them to similar oversight, and leave customers hanging in a convoluted bankruptcy process in the event that a stablecoin firm should fail. They had also tried to rally opposition to the bill by arguing that voting in favour was effectively condoning Trump's business activities - including his family's promotion of their own crypto coins.But it nevertheless drew significant support from Democrats, about half of which supported the bill, as well as the majority of Republicans. \"Some members may believe passage of this bill, even with flaws, is better than the status quo. We believe this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the risks involved with these instruments,\" a coalition of consumer and advocacy groups wrote in a letter to Congress this spring. They warned that passage would \"allow the proliferation of assets that consumers will wrongly perceive as safe\".Analysts had expected Congress to pass all three bills earlier this week, but unexpected hiccups led to delays. The two other bills have passed the House and are headed to the Senate, where Republicans hold a narrow majority. Those bills would prevent the US central bank from establishing a digital currency and set up a regulatory framework for other forms of crypto.The advance comes as Trump is reportedly working on an presidential order that could allow retirement accounts to be invested in private assets, such as crypto, gold and private equity.The value of Bitcoin hit a new record this week, passing $120,000 (£89,000).But Terry Haines of Washington-based analysis firm Pangaea Policy, said he did not expect the other two bills, which are more significant, to go further. \"This is the end of crypto's wins for quite a while - and the only one,\" he wrote. \"When the easy part, stablecoin, takes ~4 to 5 years and barely survives industry scandals, it's not much to crow about.\"The Bitcoin hum that is unsettling Trump's MAGA heartlandsDonald TrumpUnited StatesCryptocurrencyTechnology"

Mr Sarandos made his comments as Netflix announced a 16% rise in revenue to $11bn (£8.25bn) for the three months to the end of June compared to the same period last year. Profits rose from $2.1bn to $3.1bn.The streaming firm said the better-than-expected performance was boosted by the success of the third and final series of South Korean thriller Squid Game, which has so far attracted 122 million views.Asked about Netflix's use of AI, Mr Sarandos said the technology has allowed productions with smaller budgets to use advanced visual effects.The generative AI used in The Eternaut helped its production team to complete a sequence showing the collapse of a building in Buenos Aires 10 times faster than if they had used traditional special effects tools, he said.\"The cost of it would just wouldn't have been feasible for a show in that budget.\"That sequence actually is the very first [generative] AI final footage to appear on screen in a Netflix original series or film. So the creators were thrilled with the result,\" said Mr Sarandos.AI was among the key concerns raised during a Hollywood strike in 2023. During the three-month walkout, the Screen Actors Guild–American Federation of Television and Radio Artists union called for tighter regulation of the use of AI.Some in the industry have criticised the use of AI in film, calling it degrading to the craft. In 2024, film mogul Tyler Perry halted plans for a $800m expansion of his studio in Atlanta over fears that the rapid advancement in AI-generated videos would affect jobs.  AI tools like OpenAI's Sora were being announced at the time, causing awe at the quality of footage it could create from simple text prompts, but also concerns about job security. Davier Yoon, co-founder of Singapore animation studio CraveFX, said Netflix's adoption of generative AI came as no surprise as more major studios are welcoming the technology. Generative AI adds to the list of digital tools that visual effect artists can pick to bring ideas to life, he said. \"It feels like a matter of time. AI definitely opens the gate to allow smaller studios to achieve big budget-looking visuals,\" said Mr Yoon. \"Ultimately, it is the artist who decides what is in the final image, not AI.\"ArgentinaArtificial intelligenceNetflixInternational businessTechnology"

It is unclear how much they agreed to settle for.The settlement was announced on Thursday by a lawyer for the shareholders, just before the trial was about to enter its second day in a Delaware court. Meta declined to comment on the settlement.The Meta shareholders had alleged that Mr Zuckerberg's actions led to the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which the data of millions of Facebook users was leaked and used by a political consulting firm. The shareholders had asked the judge to order the 11 defendants named in the case to reimburse Meta for more than $8bn in fines and legal costs, which they say the company has had to pay in order to resolve claims of users' privacy breaches.The shareholders also questioned the timing of share sales by top brass at the company.Meta was formerly known as Facebook, and is the parent company of the social media platform, along with photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging app WhatsApp. The shareholder lawsuit was filed in 2018, after it was revealed that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked for President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. Among the defendants was Jeffrey Zients, who served as Meta director for two years starting in May 2018, and was also former President Joe Biden's White House chief of staff.In testimony on Wednesday, Mr Zients acknowledged that a $5 billion Federal Trade Commission fine was substantial, but said that the company did not agree to pay it to protect Mr Zuckerberg from legal liability.Other defendants included Peter Thiel, co-founder of Palantir Technologies, and Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix. The settlement allows the defendants to avoid testifying under oath.Former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg had also been slated to testify. \"One thing that could have come out of a full trial is a full accounting of how Facebook came to adopt and approve any illegal practices,\" said Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado.\"It's valuable for society to know how this happened and what went wrong that they were breaking the law, if they were breaking the law,\" Lipton added. \"That kind of exposure serves a valuable social purpose. We won't get that accounting now.\"Meta was not a direct party to the lawsuit but has said that its has invested billions of dollars in privacy reforms since 2019.Prior to the settlement, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, a Delaware judge, was set to hear testimony through next week before rendering a decision.Last year, Ms McCormick drew the ire of Tesla boss Elon Musk after she rejected his $56 billion pay package.

In 2024 Into Games released a report which found there was a \"really high number of people in working-class and low-income backgrounds coming through existing game educational pathways,\" Declan said.But not many of them actually completed that journey and got jobs.\"They're being failed at the last hurdle,\" he added.OtherOver 5,000 games industry professionals attend Develop:Brighton each yearThe Into Games report highlighted barriers such as location, access to finance, reduced cultural capital and lack of networks which prevented people from lower socio-economic backgrounds from breaking into the industry.It found that 59% of participants said they had been made to feel \"othered\" at some point in their career.Will Luton, the founder of Village Studio Games, attended the event in Brighton and said he had \"felt overt discrimination\" due to his class.He added he often found himself having to \"mask\" or \"rework\" the way he talked so he didn't \"give away\" where he was from.Will argued that those like himself who had made it into the industry had a part to play in highlighting the problem, rather than suggesting that just because \"they were in\" the industry, it suddenly \"wasn't an issue\". The report also suggested the gaming sector had a smaller proportion of people coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds (13%) compared to film and TV (29%) or music and visual arts (22%).Nick Poole, head of games industry body Ukie, believed that while the talent was available, the \"opportunity wasn't\".\"If you're going to tell real stories, people who are young, gifted and broke need to be able to find their way into the industry,\" Nick said.'Huge' benefits for studiosDeclan Cassidy hopes Into Games' approach can help those from working class backgrounds across the UK find their place within a precarious sector, which in recent years has seen thousands of jobs lost across the globe.The organisation plans to focus support on six areas - Birmingham, Brighton, Dundee, London, Manchester and Tees Valley - in the next five years.The support will include targeting outreach in schools, paid internships and government-funded training, with the group stating that over 100 game studios have confirmed they will take on working-class talent through their programmes in 2025 and 2026.\"By 2030, our aim is to be increasing the number of people from working-class backgrounds in the UK games industry by a factor of 50%,\" Declan said.The benefit could be \"huge for studios,\" he added.

His father, who faced legal troubles of his own, suffered a heart attack in 2014 and died in 2020.The younger Lee was first arrested in 2017 for bribing an advisor to former President Park Geun-hye to smooth his succession at Samsung.Over the course of his legal problems, he had separate jail terms cut short - one due to a special presidential pardon when he was on parole from prison. At the time, the government said the leader of the country's biggest company was needed to spearhead South Korea's economic recovery in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.In 2024, a district court cleared Lee of all charges linked to the merger worth around $8bn (£5.97bn) of two of its subsidiaries.Lee was cleared again after prosecutors appealed the case in the High Court.The legal cases over the past decade have added to Samsung's troubles as it struggled with intensifying competition.Samsung Electronics, which has major operations making smartphones and computer chips, has been facing declining sales in recent years.Last year during a trial, Lee acknowledged that Samsung faces major challenges.\"The reality facing [Samsung] is harder than ever, but I will overcome and take a step forward,\" he said.US President Donald Trump's tariffs are another potential hurdle for Samsung, which exports a large number of products to America.The court's decision was welcomed by the country's business community.The Federation of Korean Industries said in a statement that the ruling will allow swift decisions at the top of Samsung, which will help the economy navigate trade turmoil with the US.Mergers and acquisitionsInternational BusinessSamsungSouth Korea"

Age verification companies, who are likely to be employed, say people should be reassured because firms don't retain data, and they don't know what a person has accessed.\"The only non-hackable database is no database at all,\" says Iain Corby, of the Age Verification Providers Association. Chelsea Jarvie, a cyber security expert, says society needs to be cautious about \"normalising mass identification online\".There are a number of ways an adult website may choose to verify a user's age, and Ofcom has recommended seven methods. A website may allow a combination of them to give people choice. Let's look at them.Credit card age checksGetty ImagesHow it worksYou provide your credit card details and a payment processor checks if the card is valid.What are the privacy issues?Age verification firm Verifymy says when you carry out this check on its service, a two-factor authentication check and a mini transaction with no exchange of money takes place, similar to checking into a hotel. \"No personal data gets passed on to an adult platform in any way. It is simply a yes or no as to answering a question: is this individual over 18?\", said Andy Lulham, Verifymy's chief operating officer.The 5RightsFoundation - an online child safety charity - said credit card checks, along with the photo identification and digital identity verification methods, offered high levels of assurance especially when the data was well protected, but \"carry significant privacy risks if not designed and managed appropriately\". Digital identity servicesHow it worksThese include digital identity wallets, which can securely store and share information which proves your age.What are the privacy issues?Omari Rodney is the chief product engineer for Yoti.He told BBC News once a document such as a passport was examined and verified, all parts of it were then separated and encrypted. The only person who could decrypt it was the individual.\"We can't see that information unless we get permission from you,\" he said.Luciditi, another verification firm, said the user could choose to share a part of their identity - that they were over the age of 18.Ms Jarvie, however, thinks digital wallets - along with open banking - \"can feel disproportionate\" as a method to prove you are over 18.Email-based age estimationHow it worksYou provide your email address, and technology analyses other online services where it has been used - such as banking or utility providers - to estimate your age.What are the privacy issues?Verifymy are one of operators, and it told the BBC its research identified this as the method users would be most comfortable with.Mr Lulham says the technology checks if an email has been used to interact with a range of websites such as financial institutions.Verifymy said data could be kept for up to 28 days, but added it would often be less, would be encrypted, and no data would be shared with the website being accessed.Facial age estimationGetty ImagesHow it worksYou show your face via photo or video, and technology analyses it to estimate your age.What are the privacy issues?A verification company would typically check if it is a human, only one person, and not a picture.Yoti use an AI model to determine a person's age. While facial age estimation \"can be accurate\", Ms Jarvie said her research indicated many people would not be comfortable using this method.Mobile network operator age checksHow it worksYou give your permission for an age-check service to confirm whether or not your mobile phone number has age filters applied to it. What are the privacy issues?Yoti looks at who the bill payer is, and if it is an adult paying for a child's phone - such as on a family plan. The mobile operator is asked to confirm the age of the person, but would not know which website they intend on accessing.Verification company OneID has the user log into their digital ID via their phone number, with the mobile operator confirming if the person is over 18.Verifymy said pay as you go numbers wouldn't be compatible - users would need to have a phone contract.Open BankingHow it worksYou give permission for the age-check service to securely access information from your bank about whether you are over 18.What are the privacy issues?OneID uses this method if a user cannot verify they are over the age of 18 via their mobile operator.While OneID does not see your transactions, your account number and sort code are shared with it during its one-off check - but the company says it does not keep any details.OneID founder Rob Kotlarz accepts users may be reluctant to show their bank details so they can access an adult website.\"It is the right thing to protect children,\" he told BBC News. \"We are offering a simpler way of checking someone's age. If it is simple and seamless, why wouldn't you do it to protect the kids?\"Photo ID matchingGetty ImagesHow it worksYou upload an image of an ID document that shows your face and age, and an image of yourself at the same time. These are then compared to confirm the document is yours.What are the privacy issues?As well as UK documents, Yoti would allow the user to upload some from outside of the UK.Ms Jarvie believes photo ID uploads and credit card checks \"feel outdated\" and \"highly intrusive\".How can you keep your child safe online?What is AI and how does it work?Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

The firm says it aims to reduce \"accent discrimination\" experienced by workers when callers fail to understand them.Endangered languages and dialectsThere is concern that languages and dialects are being lost in the digital era.\"Among the over seven thousand languages that still exist today, almost half are endangered according to UNESCO; about a third have some online presence; less than 2 percent are supported by Google Translate; and according to OpenAI's own testing, only fifteen, or 0.2 percent are supported by GPT-4 [an OpenAI model] above an 80 percent accuracy,\" writes Karen Hao in the book Empire of AI.\"Language models are homogenising speech,\" agrees AI expert Henry Ajder, who advises governments and tech firms, including Synthesia.However, the better these products become, the more effective they will also be in the hands of scammers.Synthesia's product will not be free when it is released in the coming weeks, and will have guardrails around hate speech and explicit material.But there are already many free, open-source voice-cloning tools which are easily accessible and less protected.At the beginning of July, messages generated by an AI-cloned voice impersonating US Secretary of State Marco Rubio were reported to have been sent to ministers.\"The open source landscape for voice has evolved so rapidly over the last nine to 12 months,\" Mr Ajder adds.\"And that, from a safety perspective, is a real concern.\"Council AI helper struggling to grasp local dialect'My new voice is a dream come true'Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

The chips have been a key focus of export controls aimed at keeping the cutting-edge technology out of Beijing's hands as the AI race between the US and China heats up.The US Department of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The H20 chip was developed specifically for the Chinese market after US export restrictions were imposed by the Biden administration in 2023. Its sale was effectively banned by the Trump administration in April this year. The announcement came as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington have been easing.In May, the two governments agreed a temporary truce in their tariffs war.They set a 12 August deadline to reach a longer term deal over the high tariffs imposed on each other since Trump returned to the White House this year.In recent weeks, Beijing has relaxed trade controls on rare earth exports, while the US has lifted restrictions on chip design software firms operating in China.Nvidia has long viewed China as a crucial market, with the country ranking among its top buyers globally.Nvidia's chief executive Jensen Huang has spent months lobbying both sides for a resumption of sales of H20 chips in China.The company said that Mr Huang, who is currently in China, met Trump to reaffirm Nvidia's commitment to create jobs and ensure the US leads in AI worldwide.Mr Huang also met Chinese government and industry officials to discuss how AI can raise productivity and ways to advance research safely.Last week, Nvidia became the first company in the world to reach a market value of $4tn (£2.3tn).Trump tariffsChinaArtificial intelligenceNvidiaInternational businessTechnology"

It's wonderful to escape the heat, they say.And who can blame them. Climate change is making the UK hotter. In order to do something about that, decarbonising our energy systems – including domestic heating – is becoming more and more urgent. Heat pumps run on electricity, not oil or gas, and Octopus is manufacturing heat pumps of its own design right here in Northern Ireland.\"It kind of gets harder as you go up – it's like levels in a game,\" says Patrick Doran, one of the workers here, after I view the production line.He's referring to how, in just under a year, he's completed training in each stage of the manufacturing process.From fitting pipework to attaching bundles of cables, which connect up the heat pump's internal electronics. \"I get to do something different every day,\" enthuses Doran.The government wants to see 600,000 heat pumps going in to UK homes annually by 2028, just three years away.While installations have quickened recently, the country remains far behind that target. Total UK heat pump sales were slightly below 100,000 in 2024.Demand for heat pumps boomed in Europe when gas prices spiralled following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 – but that enthusiasm has since cooled.Gas has become slightly cheaper again meaning that heat pumps are finding it harder to compete against gas boilers in terms of running costs.This factory, in a medium-sized warehouse, can churn out 600 heat pumps per month, I'm told – and this will soon double when a second production line becomes active.And in principle, Octopus could introduce additional shifts here and make many times that number of units. If higher demand materialises.\"We can have a plug-and-play solution that works in the majority of homes in the UK,\" says Aimee Clark, head of commercial, as she explains why Octopus wanted to manufacture its own heat pump – which is unusual among electricity providers, to say the least.Chris BaraniukOctopus heat pumps have an unusual designOther heat pump makers, including Vaillant, have UK manufacturing sites. And Copeland, which makes heat pumps components, has a factory here in Northern Ireland. It supplies compressors to Octopus.Heat pumps work by absorbing heat from the environment, usually the air. It's a way of harvesting free heat, if you like.Ambient heat causes a refrigerant inside the heat pump to warm up and expand. A compressor squeezes that refrigerant, raising its temperature yet further.Finally, a heat exchanger transfers this heat to water that gets pumped around your radiators, for instance.The Octopus heat pumps sport an unusual design. They come in a dark grey plastic casing. I have to admit, to me, it looks a little bit dour – but it packs some original tech.Mateusz Dewhurst, director of manufacturing, points out an internal metal plate the company has patented – refrigerant flows through this plate, absorbing heat from the machine's electronics and cooling them down. \"That's a performance gain,\" says Mr Dewhurst.He also says the heat pump's casing contains small grey insulation beads to reduce heat loss from the system. Exactly the same kind of beads that are sometimes used to insulate cavity walls in buildings, he explains.Chris BaraniukOctopus can track the performance of a heat pump with internal sensorsHeat pump technology has been around since the 1800s.Zhiwei Ma at Durham University says manufacturing these devices is relatively straightforward – he made one himself when he was a PhD student.\"It worked fine,\" he recalls. Companies such as Octopus are able to buy in the main components and assemble a finished product. \"There's very little room to improve anything,\" argues Dr Ma.Octopus would perhaps disagree. They say their design choices make a difference to overall performance, which the firm can track thanks to the many heat and pressure sensors it secretes within the device.Heat pumps can produce multiple kilowatts of heat for every kilowatt of electricity they consume, a ratio known as their co-efficient of performance (Cop). Ensuring the Cop is as high as possible really matters in terms of keeping running costs low.Octopus technicians can intervene should data from a heat pump's sensors indicate a severe dip in performance. And customers also get an overview of their heat pump's efficiency via a smartphone app.Getty ImagesGetting a heat pump installed correctly is keyEnsuring that heat pumps are installed competently is paramount, says Steven Metcalf at the University of Warwick. He and colleagues occasionally work with Mitsubishi, which has a heat pump factory in Scotland.\"It could be the difference of a Cop of 2.5 versus 4 – your bills will scale with that,\" he explains. \"It can be a huge penalty for getting a bad install.\"Public acceptance of heat pumps rests on people having confidence that switching to such a system won't turn out to be a massive headache – though it's worth saying that, in other countries such as colder Norway, heat pumps have long been embraced by locals.Octopus says surveys of its customers suggest a majority find their heat pump costs the same or less than their old gas boiler, and provides heat that is just as comfortable if not more so.Taxing fossil fuels harder is one way to spur demand for domestic appliances that use electricity as an alternative, says Paul Kenny, director general of the European Heat Pump Association, an industry body.\"Right now what we have is factories that are at low capacity factors, they're idle or running well below what they could be running,\" he says, referring to the slackening demand for heat pumps in Europe at present.There could also be greater consistency regarding subsidies.Despite having the highest proportion of especially-polluting oil heating systems of any UK nation, Northern Ireland is the only region within the UK or Ireland that doesn't have a widely available grant to reduce the cost of a heat pump installation.I point out the irony, therefore, of making heat pumps here to TJ Root, Octopus's Cosy program director, after my factory tour. \"It's incredibly ironic,\" he agrees.More Technology of BusinessWhy little Lithuania has big plans for space techWhy Ukraine is one of the world's most digital countriesFrom festivals to weddings: Why drone shows are boomingInternational BusinessClimateTechnology of Business"

    "content": "From Bitcoin to XRP: Key cryptocurrency terms and what they mean5 days agoShareSaveLiv McMahon, Joe Tidy & Brandon DrenonBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesBitcoin's price reaching a new high of $120,000 (£89,000) - buoyed by US President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance - has kept the buzzy world of cryptocurrencies in the spotlight.But it also contains confusing terms such as ETFs, blockchains and cold wallets, that can make the topic somewhat tricky to navigate.Worry not.If you're hearing these for the first time, or simply need a refresher, here are a few key terms and what they mean.BitcoinWhile many may struggle with the finer points of crypto, pretty much everyone has heard of its most famous product: Bitcoin. But what actually is it?Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is to say a type of digital currency. Unlike traditional currencies, Bitcoin is not controlled by centralised financial institutions. This makes it popular for people who think decentralisation can bring financial freedom, but it also makes it extremely volatile with it rising and falling in value at the whim of Bitcoin buyers and sellers.Donald Trump has pledged to make the US the \"crypto capital of the world\" - backtracking on his previous claim that Bitcoin was a \"scam\".Its price topped a much-awaited threshold of $100,000 in December 2024. In mid-July 2025, the price rose to $120,000 as US politicians prepared to begin debating bills that would regulate digital assets.But its price has been known to plummet just as quickly as it spikes.Seven wild moments from the turbulent story of BitcoinTrump's strategic Bitcoin reserve criticisedBlockchainBlockchain is the technology underpinning all cryptocurrencies, and many related products like non-fungible tokens (NFTs). In essence, it is a virtual spreadsheet on which all the buying and selling of crypto is recorded. They are arranged in blocks linked together in a giant chain - hence the name.Every cryptocurrency transaction is individually recorded onto the blockchain by a huge network of volunteers verifying its authenticity by using computer programmes.The incentive to do this for Bitcoin's network is that the first person to validate transactions is rewarded in Bitcoin. This potentially lucrative process, known as mining, is also controversial because of the incredible amount of energy used as people the world over race to be the first to successfully update the blockchain.Bitcoin 'halving'The blockchain is sustained by rewarding so-called \"miners\" - whose job it is to validate transactions - by paying them with the cryptocurrency.However, unlike some other digital currencies, there is not an infinite supply of Bitcoins. The amount that can be mined is capped at 21 million, and most are already in circulation.So roughly every four years - or when the Bitcoin blockchain reaches a certain size - the number of bitcoins rewarded to those who successfully validate transactions is cut in half. The most recent Bitcoin \"halving\" (or \"halvening\") event took place on 20 April 2024, reducing the reward for miners from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125.This ensures Bitcoin's supply is drawn out for longer while demand, in theory, goes up over time. But with fewer rewards for miners, it can also lead some to consider whether it is financially worthwhile for them to continue the costly operation of running their powerful computers.Are cryptocurrencies the future of money?Crypto ExchangeA crypto exchange is the digital platform where investors can buy, sell and trade cryptocurrencies. Similar to traditional investing, a crypto exchange acts as a brokerage where people can transfer traditional money, like pounds or dollars, in exchange for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Most transactions are accompanied by fees.Crypto WalletA crypto wallet is a place where investors hold their cryptocurrency. There are two types, a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are connected to the internet, and thus more accessible for quick transfers and easy access. Cold wallets are physical devices like specially designed USB sticks that store crypto offline typically for safer and longer term storage.EthereumEthereum is used to describe both the second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, represented by the Ether token, and the blockchain underpinning it. This supports an array of different applications and digital assets, such as non-fungible tokens.It functions in a similar way to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but in 2022 switched to a greener operating system requiring less computers and energy.What are NFTs and why are some worth millions?Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)ETFs are portfolios that let investors bet on multiple assets without having to buy any themselves. Traded on stock exchanges like shares, their value depends on how the overall portfolio performs in real time. They can comprise a combination of gold and silver bullion, for example, or a mix of shares in both technology and insurance companies.A spot Bitcoin ETF buys the cryptocurrency directly, \"on the spot\", at its current price, throughout the day. While some ETFs already contained Bitcoin indirectly, the US approved several spot Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024. This allowed new investors, such as investment management firms like Blackrock and Fidelity, to enter the speculative world of Bitcoin without having to worry about digital wallets or navigating crypto exchanges.How big banks are becoming 'Bitcoin whales'Meme coinsMeme coins are a form of cryptocurrency used for fun and speculation. They are typically created to capitalise on social media trends or viral memes - such as for internet-famous pygmy hippo Moo Deng. But meme coins are heavily criticised for their speculative nature and the risk involved for investors, as they often have little prospect of accumulating value over time.They can also be susceptible to \"rug pulls\" - where promoters of a cryptocurrency draw in buyers to raise the price of their coin, only to stop trading activity and make off with the money raised from sales.Some celebrities have faced backlash after launching meme coins.'A mockery': Trump's meme-coin sparks anger in crypto worldOnline star Hawk Tuah girl faces crypto coin criticismStablecoins\"Stable\" is the key word here - this cryptocurrency differs from others as it is intends to be less volatile in value.This typically works by the price being linked to an existing asset, for instance currencies like the US dollar or pound sterling, which in theory should make them more stable in price than cryptocurrencies that are not backed by assets.Stablecoins themselves are usually controlled by companies that provide them, with transactions recorded on digital ledgers. While held up by some as the future of finance, high profile price collapses of stablecoins have alerted regulators to risks for investors and prompted scrutiny over their supposed stability.Cryptocurrency firm Terraform, behind the crashed TerraUSD and Luna tokens, files for bankruptcyXRPXRP is a cryptocurrency used by a platform called the XRP Ledger. It was created by the co-founders of financial services company Ripple Labs in 2012 as a cheaper, faster alternative to Bitcoin.The cryptocurrency has a fixed supply of 100 billion coins, which were created when it launched. Much of it is held by Ripple and periodically released into circulation.Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, transactions made using XRP are verified through consensus - whereby the majority of validators on its peer-to-peer network must agree whether or not a transaction is valid before it is added to its blockchain.This has been credited with allowing many transactions to take place simultaneously, at high speed and low cost - making it appealing to financial institutions or for processes like cross-border payments. But as with other cryptocurrencies, XRP has received regulatory scrutiny and seen sudden, sharp declines in value.Protestors accuse Trump of corruption as he hosts crypto gala dinnerThe Bitcoin hum that is unsettling Trump's MAGA heartlandsWhat next for Bitcoin after bursting $100k barrier?Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

But she acknowledged Ofcom may require further legal powers in order to keep pace with the rapidly developing impact of artificial intelligence (AI).How can you keep your child safe online?Dads call for ban on smartphones in schoolsUnder new powers introduced by the Online Safety Act and passed under the previous Tory government, Ofcom will require internet companies to conduct stricter age verification methods to check whether a user is under 18.A new code of practice, to apply from 25 July, will also require platforms to change algorithms affecting what is shown in children's feeds to filter out harmful content.At the last election, Labour committed to \"build on\" the previous government's law and consider further measures to keep children safe.But it is yet to publish fresh legislation of its own, with ministers arguing the existing set of new regulations need to be rolled out first.Speaking to Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Ian Russell, whose daughter Molly took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online, said the new rules should mark the \"biggest moment in online safety\" since the arrival of social media.But he added the \"proof of the pudding is in what happens,\" adding he thought Ofcom could go further than it has done within the legal powers it has acquired.He also argued that the regulator should be prepared to \"push back\" against ministers over \"weaknesses\" in the legislation.'Addictive habits'Alexander said the new rules would bring in \"really robust safeguards\" to ensure proper age verification.But she added: \"We are very clear as a government that this is the foundation for a safer online experience for children, but it is not the end of the conversation\".She said Technology Secretary Peter Kyle was looking at further action in a number of areas, including how to address \"addictive habits\" among children.\"We're not going to be a government that sits back and waits on this, we want to address it,\" she added. She did not provide further details, but Kyle has previously indicated he wants to curb the \"addictive nature\" of apps and smartphones for children.Proposals under consideration include a two-hour cap on the use of individual social media apps, and a 22:00 curfew.Phone ban callsAlexander added that the education secretary was reviewing guidance in England that allows individual headteachers to ban smartphones in schools.The government has so far stopped short of legislating for a nationwide ban, voting down a Tory attempt to do so in March.The transport secretary added that it was important to \"get the balance right\" on the issue, noting that some parents \"want their kids to have a phone on their way to school\".Shadow minister Chris Philp said he wished the previous Tory government had legislated to ban smartphones in schools during its 14 years in power.He told Kuenssberg it was a \"great shame\" Labour had not backed a ban, adding: \"As a dad myself, I am really concerned about this\".Ofcom's chief executive told the programme the new rules would mean tech platforms would have to change their content algorithms \"very significantly\".Ms Dawes said the regulator would give websites some flexibility when deciding which age-verification tools to use, but pledged that those failing to put adequate checks in place \"will hear from us with enforcement action\".However, she acknowledged some newer forms of AI \"may not\" be covered be powers contained in the existing legislation.\"There may need to be some changes to the legislation to cover that,\" she added.

Electronic devices were also seized by the police.One of the suspects - a 19-year-old man - is from Latvia, the rest are from the UK.Neighbours described a large police operation in the quiet Staffordshire cul-de-sac  where the 20-year-old was arrested.They said dozens of NCA officers, some wearing balaclavas, arrived in the early hours of this morning and smashed down the door of a family home. Later they were seen taking away a large number of electronic devices.Paul Foster, head of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit, said the arrests were a \"significant step\" in its investigation.\"But our work continues, alongside partners in the UK and overseas, to ensure those responsible are identified and brought to justice,\" he added.Neighbours say NCA officers removed electronic devices from one propertyThe hacks - which began in mid April - have caused huge disruption for the two retailers. Some Co-op shelves were left bare for weeks, while M&S expects its operations to be affected until late July, with some IT systems not fully operational until October or November.The chairman of M&S told MPs this week that it felt like the hack was an attempt to destroy the business. The retailer has estimated it will cost it £300m in lost profits.Harrods was also targeted in an attack that had less impact on its operations.A wave of attacksM&S was the first to be breached. A huge amount of private data belonging to customers and staff was stolen. The criminals also deployed malicious software called ransomware scrambling the company's IT networks making them unusable unless a ransom was paid. The BBC revealed that the hackers had sent an offensive email to the M&S boss demanding payment.   A few days after M&S was breached the Co-op was also targeted by criminals who broke in and stole the private data of millions of its customers and staff. The Co-op was forced to admit that the data breach had happened after hackers contacted the BBC with proof that the firm was downplaying the cyber attack.The BBC later discovered from the criminals that the company disconnected the internet from IT networks in the nick of time to stop the hackers from deploying ransomware and so causing even more disruption.Shortly after Co-op announced it had been attacked, luxury retailer Harrods said it too had been targeted and had been forced to disconnect IT systems from the internet to keep the criminals out. The four people arrested are a 17-year-old British male from the West Midlands, a 19-year-old British man from London, a 19-year-old Latvian male from the West Midlands and a 20-year-old British woman from Staffordshire.The NCA said its operation was supported by officers from the West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit and the East Midlands Special Operations Unit.Retail hackers believed to be young and from US and UK, detectives sayA letter from the M&S hackers landed in my inbox - this is what happened nextSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

That is being addressed.\"Screenshots published on social media show the chatbot saying the Nazi leader would be the best person to respond to alleged \"anti-white hate.\"Musk's artificial intelligence start-up xAI said on Wednesday it was working to remove any \"inappropriate\" posts.ADL, an organisation formed to combat antisemitism and other forms of discrimination, said the posts were \"irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic.\"\"This supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the antisemitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms,\" ADL wrote on X.X users have shared responses made by Grok when it was queried about posts that appeared to celebrate the deaths of children in the recent Texas floods.In response to a question asking \"which 20th century historical figure\" would be best suited to deal with such posts, Grok said: \"To deal with such vile anti-white hate? Adolf Hitler, no question.\" \"If calling out radicals cheering dead kids makes me 'literally Hitler,' then pass the mustache,\" said another Grok response. \"Truth hurts more than floods.\"Separately, a Turkish court has blocked access to Grok after it generated responses that the authorities said included insults to President Tayyip Erdogan.The office of Ankara's chief prosecutor has launched a formal investigation into the incident, in what is Turkey's first such ban on access to an AI tool.Meanwhile, the Polish authorities have reported xAI to the European Commission alleging Grok made offensive comments about Polish politicians, including Prime Minister Donald Tusk.Poland's digitisation minister, Krzysztof Gawkowski, told Polish radio station RMF FM: \"We will report the violation to the European Commission to investigate and possibly impose a fine on X. Freedom of speech belongs to humans, not to artificial intelligence.\"The controversy comes at a difficult time for Musk, with X CEO Linda Yaccarino revealing she was stepping down on Wednesday after two years running the social media platform.What is AI and how does it work?Who is Elon Musk and what is his net worth?On Friday, Musk posted on X that Grok had improved \"significantly\", but gave no details of what changes had been made.\"You should notice a difference when you ask Grok questions,\" he added.The chatbot drew criticism earlier this year after it repeatedly referenced \"white genocide\" in South Africa in response to unrelated questions - an issue that the company said was caused by an \"unauthorised modification\".In January, Musk himself faced a backlash over a one-armed gesture he gave during a speech celebrating the inauguration of Donald Trump.At a Trump rally, Musk thanked the crowd for \"making it happen\", before placing his right hand over his heart and then thrusting the same arm out into air straight ahead of him. He then turned and repeated the action for those sitting behind him.Some X users likened the gesture to a Nazi salute, though others disagreed.In response, the SpaceX and Tesla chief posted on X: \"Frankly, they need better dirty tricks. The 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired.\"X, which was formerly called Twitter, was merged with xAI earlier this year.Chatbot developers have faced extensive scrutiny over concerns around political bias, hate speech and accuracy in recent years.Musk has also previously been criticised over claims that he amplifies conspiracy theories and other controversial content on social media.Trump calls Musk's new political party 'ridiculous' Will Musk's explosive row with Trump help or harm his businesses?Elon MuskInternational businessTwitterArtificial intelligenceTechnology"

    "content": "Linda Yaccarino departs as boss of Musk's X9 July 2025ShareSaveGraham Fraser, Zoe Kleinman, and Lily JamaliBBC NewsShareSaveGetty ImagesLinda Yaccarino, the boss of Elon Musk's social media site X, has announced she is stepping down after two years. Her departure comes at a time of tumult for the platform, which was taken over by Musk's artificial intelligence (AI) venture, xAI, in March, and has been in the spotlight for antisemitic posts churned out by its AI chatbot, Grok. In a post on X, Ms Yaccarino said she was \"immensely grateful\" to Musk for \"entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App\".Musk posted a brief reply, saying only: \"Thank you for your contributions.\"The BBC has approached X for comment. It is not clear what sparked the decision, or whether there has been any break down in the relationship between the two leaders. Ms Yaccarino was previously head of advertising at NBCUniversal, where she was credited with helping to steer it through the upheaval caused by technology firms.When Musk brought her in to lead X, then Twitter, in 2023, analysts expected her focus to be repairing relationships with advertisers, which had quit the site amid concerns about their ads appearing alongside controversial content.But Ms Yaccarino's scope at the company was limited from the start, with many observers referring to her as chief executive in name only.\"Her background and actual authority positioned her more as the company's chief advertising officer, rather than its CEO. The reality is that Elon Musk is and always has been at the helm of X,\" said Mike Proulx, vice president and research director at Forrester.\"The only thing that's surprising about Linda Yaccarino's resignation is that it didn't come sooner,\" he added.Advertising turnaround?Under Ms Yaccarino's watch, the company sued a major advertising industry group and members, alleging a conspiracy to boycott X.The industry group shuttered shortly after the lawsuit was filed.The platform's tone changed significantly during the course of Yaccarino's tenure. Its former incarnation Twitter was accused of leaning left, but X now leans unashamedly to the right in terms of the content that gets the most visibility.Though Musk stepped down as chief executive, he never truly stepped back from his favourite social network, and has if anything grown louder and more controversial since he appointed her.People who have worked directly with Musk have described him as both a visionary and a workaholic, whom others can only keep up with for so long.\"Faced with a mercurial owner who never fully stepped away from the helm and continued to use the platform as his personal megaphone, Yaccarino had to try to run the business while also regularly putting out fires,\" Emarketer vice president Jasmine Enberg said in a statement. She said her firm expected X's ad business to return to growth this year, after more than halving after Musk's takeover. But she added: \"The reasons for X's ad recovery are complicated, and Yaccarino was unable to restore the platform's reputation among advertisers.\"In Ms Yaccarino's departure post, she said that she had decided to step down after \"two incredible years\".She added: \"When Elon Musk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the extraordinary mission of this company.\"Ms Yaccarino's exit comes at a difficult time for Musk, who is dealing with falling sales at his car maker Tesla, which has also seen the departure of a number of top executives.He is also embroiled in a war of words with his former political ally, US President Donald Trump, culminating in Musk planning a new political party.X has also continued to attract controversy.The most recent of these has seen Musk's chatbot, Grok - which is embedded in X - speak favourably about Hitler among other antisemitic posts early this week. Musk on Friday had said the company had been working to overhaul Grok and that users \"should notice a difference\" when asking Grok questions.In instructions posted publicly by the company, Grok was directed to \"[a]ssume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased\" and to \"not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect.\"In a statement, xAI said it was working to remove what it called \"inappropriate\" posts.Linda Yaccarino replaces Elon Musk as Twitter bossWho is Linda Yaccarino, Twitter's 'superwoman'?Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

It's been horrible, not to mention having an accusation like that over my head,\" one of the men told BBC News.Meta declined to comment.BBC News has been contacted by more than 100 people who claim to have been wrongly banned by Meta. Some talk of a loss of earnings after being locked out of their business pages, while others highlight the pain of no longer having access to years of pictures and memories. Many point to the impact it has had on their mental health.Over 27,000 people have signed a petition that accuses Meta's moderation system, powered by artificial intelligence (AI), of falsely banning accounts and then having an appeal process that is unfit for purpose.Thousands of people are also in Reddit forums dedicated to the subject, and many users have posted on social media about being banned. Meta has previously acknowledged a problem with Facebook Groups but denied its platforms were more widely affected.'Outrageous and vile'The BBC has changed the names of the people in this piece to protect their identities.David, from Aberdeen in Scotland, was suspended from Instagram on 4 June. He was told he had not followed Meta's community standards on child sexual exploitation, abuse and nudity.He appealed that day, and was then permanently disabled on Instagram and his associated Facebook and Facebook Messenger accounts.David found a Reddit thread, where many others were posting that they had also been wrongly banned over child sexual exploitation.\"We have lost years of memories, in my case over 10 years of messages, photos and posts - due to a completely outrageous and vile accusation,\" he told BBC News.He said Meta was \"an embarrassment\", with AI-generated replies and templated responses to his questions. He still has no idea why his account was banned.\"I've lost endless hours of sleep, extreme stress, felt isolated. It's been horrible, not to mention having an accusation like that over my head.\"Although you can speak to people on Reddit, it is hard to go and speak to a family member or a colleague. They probably don't know the context that there is a ban wave going on.\"The BBC raised David's case to Meta on 3 July, as one of a number of people who claimed to have been wrongly banned over child sexual exploitation. Within hours, his account was reinstated.In a message sent to David, and seen by the BBC, the tech giant said: \"We're sorry that we've got this wrong, and that you weren't able to use Instagram for a while. Sometimes, we need to take action to help keep our community safe.\"\"It is a massive weight off my shoulders,\" said David.How can you keep your child safe online?What is AI and how does it work?Faisal was banned from Instagram on 6 June over alleged child sexual exploitation and, like David, found his Facebook account suspended too. The student from London is embarking on a career in the creative arts, and was starting to earn money via commissions on his Instagram page when it was suspended. He appealed after feeling he had done nothing wrong, and his account was then banned a few minutes later.He told BBC News: \"I don't know what to do and I'm really upset.\"[Meta] falsely accuse me of a crime that I have never done, which also damages my mental state and health and it has put me into pure isolation throughout the past month.\" His case was also raised with Meta by the BBC on 3 July. About five hours later, his accounts were reinstated. He received the exact same email as David, with the apology from Meta.He told BBC News he was \"quite relieved\" after hearing the news. \"I am trying to limit my time on Instagram now.\"Faisal said he remained upset over the incident, and is now worried the account ban might come up if any background checks are made on him.A third user Salim told BBC News that he also had accounts falsely banned for child sexual exploitation violations.He highlighted his case to journalists, stating that appeals are \"largely ignored\", business accounts were being affected, and AI was \"labelling ordinary people as criminal abusers\".Almost a week after he was banned, his Instagram and Facebook accounts were reinstated.What's gone wrong?When asked by BBC News, Meta declined to comment on the cases of David, Faisal, and Salim, and did not answer questions about whether it had a problem with wrongly accusing users of child abuse offences.It seems in one part of the world, however, it has acknowledged there is a wider issue.The BBC has learned that the chair of the Science, ICT, Broadcasting, and Communications Committee at the National Assembly in South Korea, said last month that Meta had acknowledged the possibility of wrongful suspensions for people in her country.Dr Carolina Are, a social media researcher at Northumbria University's Centre for Digital Citizens, said it was hard to know what the root of the problem was because Meta was not being open about it.However, she suggested it could be due to recent changes to the wording of some its community guidelines and an ongoing lack of a workable appeal process.\"Meta often don't explain what it is that triggered the deletion. We are not privy to what went wrong with the algorithm,\" she told BBC News.In a previous statement, Meta said: \"We take action on accounts that violate our policies, and people can appeal if they think we've made a mistake.\" Meta, in common with all big technology firms, have come under increased pressure in recent years from regulators and authorities to make their platforms safe spaces.Meta told the BBC it used a combination of people and technology to find and remove accounts that broke its rules, and was not aware of a spike in erroneous account suspension.Meta says its child sexual exploitation policy relates to children and \"non-real depictions with a human likeness\", such as art, content generated by AI or fictional characters.Meta also told the BBC a few weeks ago it uses technology to identify potentially suspicious behaviours, such as adult accounts being reported by teen accounts, or adults repeatedly searching for \"harmful\" terms.Meta states that when it becomes aware of \"apparent child exploitation\", it reports it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) in the US. NCMEC told BBC News it makes all of those reports available to law enforcement around the world.'There is a problem': Facebook and Instagram users complain of account bansFacebook and Instagram get rid of fact checkersSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

Apple called the Commission's fine \"unprecedented\" on Monday, saying the decision and its penalty \"go far beyond what the law requires\".A Commission spokesperson told the BBC it took note of Apple's filing and would defend its decisions in court.The company objects to the Commission requiring it to make further concessions to app developers, including provision of tiers for services which it says introduce more complexity to its options for users and businesses.\"As our appeal will show, the [Commission] is mandating how we run our store and forcing business terms which are confusing for developers and bad for users,\" Apple said in a statement.\"We implemented this to avoid punitive daily fines and will share the facts with the Court.\"Paolo Pescatore, technology analyst at PP Foresight, said Apple's appeal was a \"widely expected move\" that \"sets the precedent for others\".\"It is disappointing that it now has to be settled in a long, drawn public process in the courts,\" he said, adding the nature of changes required by regulators - and enforcement of them - can be lengthy and complex.\"We should not underestimate the sheer complexities of having to make fundamental design, operational and commercial changes to well-established services and the time it takes to enforce them,\" he told the BBC.\"As always the devil is in the detail, which will inevitably take more time to unravel.\"EU's big tech scrutinyThe Commission's Apple fine was delivered in April alongside a penalty on Facebook owner Meta of €200m (£171m) over choice for users under its \"consent or pay\" model.The fines were the first imposed under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA) - its landmark legislation designed to boost competitive business practice in online markets.The law also carries tougher obligations for companies designated dominant \"gatekeepers\" in certain sectors, and firms face hefty fines of up to 10% of their annual global turnover for rule breaches.Henna Virkkunen, the Commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, security and democracy, said at the time that both companies had undermined the key principles of the DMA - to enable free business and choice for consumers.Apple said it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free\".It also accused the regulator of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings.It has now escalated its complaint to the EU's second highest court, the General Court.The EU's strict regulation of large US tech firms has also attracted scrutiny from President Donald Trump's administration.Trump said in January that he had \"some very big complaints with the EU\" regarding its treatment of American tech companies, likening fines upon them to \"a form of taxation\".Speaking on a podcast in October, he said Apple's boss Tim Cook had also called him to complain about the bloc's fines.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

environmental sustainability, health and national security.Lately, the institute has focused more on responsible AI and ethics, and one of its recent reports was on the increasing use of the tech by romance scammers.But Kyle's letter suggests the government wants the Turing institute to make defence its main priority, which would be a significant pivot for the organisation.\"There is an opportunity for the ATI to seize this moment,\" Kyle wrote in the letter to the institute's chairman, Dr Douglas Gurr.\"I believe the institute should build on its existing strengths, and reform itself further to prioritise its defence, national security and sovereign capabilities.\"Turing 2.0It's been a turbulent few months for the institute, which finds itself in survival mode in 2025.A review last year by UK Research and Innovation, the government funding body, found \"a clear need for the governance and leadership structure of the Institute to evolve\".At the end of 2024, 93 members of staff signed a letter expressing lack of confidence in its leadership team.In March, Jean Innes, who was appointed chief executive in July 2023, said the Turing needed to modernise and focus on AI projects, in an interview with the Financial Times.She said \"a big strategic shift to a much more focused agenda on a small number of problems that have an impact in the real world\".In April, Chief Scientist Mark Girolami said in an interview the organisation would be taking forward just 22 projects out of a portfolio of 104.Kyle's letter said the institute \"should continue to receive the funding needed to implement reforms and deliver Turing 2.0\".But he said there could be a review of the ATI's \"longer-term funding arrangement\" next year.The use of AI in defence is as powerful as it is controversial.Google's parent company Alphabet faced criticism earlier this year for removing a self-imposed ban on developing AI weapons.Meanwhile, the British military and other forces are already investing in AI-enabled tools.The government's defence review said AI technologies \"would provide greater accuracy, lethality, and cheaper capabilities\".The review said \"uncrewed and autonomous systems\" could be used within the UK's conventional forces within the next five years.In one example, the review said the Royal Navy could use \"acoustic detection systems powered by artificial intelligence\" to monitor the \"growing underwater threat from a modernising Russian submarine force\".The Nato spending target the UK has committed to involves spending at least 3.5% on core defence, and up to 1.5% on security-related investments.Asked whether any government funding that goes to the Alan Turing Institute would now count towards the defence spending target, Downing Street said the 1.5% security element would include \"investments that raise the overall resilience of our society\".The tech firm Palantir has provided data operations software to the UK's armed forces.Louis Mosley, the head of Palantir UK, told the BBC that shift the institute's focus to AI defence technologies was a good idea.He said: \"Right now we face a daunting combination of darkening geopolitics and technological revolution - with the world becoming a more dangerous place right at the moment when artificial intelligence is changing the face of war and deterrence.\"What that means in practice is that we are now in an AI arms race against our adversaries.\"And the government is right that we need to put all the resources we have into staying ahead - because that is our best path to preserving peace.\"Additional reporting by Chris Vallance, senior technology reporterNew UK centre will help fight information warConcern over Google ending ban on AI weaponsTrump says Nato's new 5% defence spending pledge a 'big win'Artificial intelligencePeter Kyle"

    "content": "AI claims and a hoax spokesman: Viral band confuses the world of music3 July 2025ShareSaveZoe KleinmanTechnology editor•@zskShareSaveThe Velvet SundownCritics say even the image of the band is AI-generatedA band called The Velvet Sundown has had its tracks played hundreds of thousands of times on Spotify since appearing several weeks ago - without anyone knowing for sure what it is.The band has a verified page on the music streaming platform, with more than 850,000 monthly listeners.However, none of the four named musicians in the band have given any interviews or appear to have individual social media accounts, and there are no records of any live performances. It has prompted accusations that they and their music are artificial intelligence (AI) generated - something the band denies on social media.It did not respond to the BBC's request for an interview.Further confusing the story, Rolling Stone US reported that the band's spokesman had admitted The Velvet Sundown's music had been generated using an AI tool called Suno - only for the magazine to report shortly afterwards that the spokesman was himself a hoax.The man, who goes by the name of Andrew Frelon, said it was a deliberate plot to hoax the media.A statement on the band's Spotify page says that the group has \"no affiliation with this individual, nor any evidence confirming their identity or existence.\"An account on X which claims to be the band's official channel, is also fake, it added.Professor Gina Neff, from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge, says it points to a problem which affects much more than just one band. \"Whether this is an AI band may not seem important,\" she told me.\"But increasingly, our collective grip on reality seems shaky. The Velvet Sundown story plays into the fears we have of losing control of AI and shows how important protecting online information is.\"'Theft dressed as competition'The Velvet Sundown's indie ballads, with guitar music and male vocals, is fairly easy, if bland, on the ear. With lyrics such as \"eyes like film in faded light, dreams walk barefoot into the night\" and \"ash and velvet, smoke and flame, calling out in freedom's name\", it could all feasibly be either AI-generated or penned by humans.Deezer, a rival music streaming platform, said that its AI detector tool had flagged the music as being \"100% AI generated\".Spotify did not respond to a request for comment.CEO Daniel Ek has previously told the BBC that he did not intend to ban AI-generated music from the platform but added that he did not agree with using the tech to mimic real artists.Many in the creative arts industry are deeply concerned about the impact of AI.Hundreds of musicians have protested about the use of their content in the training of AI tools to create music. Sir Elton John and Dua Lipa joined many members of the House of Lords in fighting for the UK government to include AI and copyright in a new set of laws regarding data use and access. Their campaign was ultimately unsuccessful. The government says it is carrying out a separate consultation about AI and copyright.Ed Newton Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, which campaigns for AI firms to respect creators' rights, said the questions around the The Velvet Sundown bore out musicians' concerns.\"This is exactly what artists have been worried about, it's theft dressed up as competition,\" he said.\"AI companies steal artists' work to build their products, then flood the market with knock-offs, meaning less money goes to human musicians.\"Sophie Jones, chief strategy officer at BPI, said it illustrated the need for government action.\"This discussion reinforces many of the concerns raised by the music industry and artist community in recent months on the critical issues of AI and music rights.Sign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "content": "'There is a problem': Facebook and Instagram users complain of account bans3 July 2025ShareSaveGraham Fraser & Imran Rahman-JonesTechnology reportersShareSaveBrittany WatsonBrittany Watson started the petition calling for Meta to answer for banning people's accountsFacebook and Instagram users have been contacting the BBC complaining about having their accounts arbitrarily banned, and struggling to get them reinstated.Last week Meta - which owns the platforms - acknowledged a \"technical error\" which it said was causing the wrongful suspension of some Facebook Groups.Since then, people who use what is the world's biggest social media company have been getting in touch with the BBC to describe the impact it is having on them - and say the problem goes much wider than Meta has indicated.Some say they have been shut out of pages that are key to their working lives, while others highlight the digital connections to loved ones that have been cut.There is also frustration that - despite Meta saying it is fixing the problem - there is often no human to speak to about an issue they suspect is caused by moderation decisions powered by artificial intelligence (AI). They have also described how Instagram accounts have been affected, despite Meta saying it does not have evidence of a problem on its platforms more widely.More than 25,000 people have signed a petition in the last few weeks which says the problem is being experienced across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Thousands of people are in Reddit forums dedicated to the subject, many users are posting on social media about being banned by Meta, and some say they plan on taking a class action lawsuit against the social media giant.Here's what people have told the BBC about what it means to them to be locked out of their social media accounts.'More than just an app'The online petition about this issue was started by Brittany Watson, a 32-year-old from Ontario, in Canada.She decided to act after her Facebook account was disabled for nine days in May before it was reinstated. She claims her page was cancelled over \"account integrity\", and Meta has not provided her with any answers as to why.\"Facebook wasn't just an app for me,\" she told BBC News. \"It was where I kept years of memories, connected with family and friends, followed pages that brought me joy, and found support communities for mental health.\"Getty ImagesWhen her account was banned, Brittany said she felt \"ashamed, embarrassed and anxiety-stricken\".\"The weight of feeling exiled from everyone takes a pretty strong hold on you,\" she added.She quickly discovered she wasn't the only one affected - thousands have signed the petition she started.\"There is a problem - it is personal accounts, it is business accounts, Facebook pages and Groups. I can't believe they [Meta] are only saying it is just Groups.\"Meta has told BBC News that it takes action on accounts that violate our policies, and \"people can appeal if they think we've made a mistake\".It has also outlined in detail how it moderates accounts using a combination of people and technology to find and remove accounts that broke its rules.It says it is not aware of a spike in erroneous account suspension.'There is no customer service'John DaleJohn Dale ran a group with over 5,000 followersAnother user who recently lost access to his Facebook account is John Dale, a former journalist who runs a local news group in west London with over 5,000 members. His account was first suspended on 30 May for breaking community standards, and the page he administers has briefly come back twice since then.He has no idea why.As he was the only administrator of the group, he currently cannot approve new posts. Additionally, his own posts have been removed from the group.\"It's frozen in time, [while] quite a lot of material has been deleted,\" he told BBC News.Mr Dale is appealing his suspension, but if he loses his appeal his account will be permanently deleted. He says he has received limited information on why he was banned.\"There is no customer service,\" he said.'My income has taken a huge hit'Michelle DeMaloMichelle DeMelo has lost money on her businesses and fears of a reputational hit after her accounts were bannedMichelle DeMelo, who is also from Canada, says she has suffered financially since her Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended in the middle of June. They were reinstated on Wednesday, a day after the BBC contacted Meta about her case.She runs several pages, with some associated with her businesses in digital marketing, and also uses Facebook Marketplace to buy and sell goods.All her accounts are linked, so when her personal Instagram page was suspended for \"violating the terms\" of a Meta policy, it triggered all of her pages to be suspended.\"My income's taken a huge hit in the past couple of weeks,\" she told BBC News from her home in Niagara Falls.\"People think I blocked them or think something happened to me.\"Michelle can't think of anything which triggered the suspension, and is worried about the reputational hit as some of her clients were left unable to contact her.She told the BBC she was relieved that after \"weeks of complete confusion and uncertainty\" her accounts had now been abruptly restored.But she said the episode had been very badly handled.\"It's insulting that a company as powerful as Meta, built by its users, offers no real human support or clear pathways for resolution in these situations.\"AI suspicions Another person left frustrated at Meta's moderation policies and its appeal process is Sam Tall, a 21-year-old from Bournemouth.He told BBC News that he discovered his Instagram page was suspended last week for breaching \"community standards\".He decided to appeal, and it was rejected two minutes later - making Sam suspect the process was entirely handled by AI.\"There is absolutely no way that was seen by a human,\" he told BBC News.\"All the memories, all my friends who I can no longer talk to because I don't have them on any other platform - gone\".As his Facebook account was linked, that was removed too.\"No explanation. I'm a bit baffled, to be honest.\"Sam says it is time for some serious action from Meta - and not just for his sake.\"If I know it is quite a few people, then there is a chance of Meta waking up and realising 'oh, this actually is an issue - let's reinstate them all.'\"Meta admits wrongly suspending Facebook Groups but denies wider problemSign up for our Tech Decoded newsletter to follow the world's top tech stories and trends.

    "content": "'Autofocus' specs promise sharp vision, near or far10 July 2025ShareSaveChris BaraniukTechnology ReporterShareSaveIXI\"People don't want to look like cyborgs,\" says Niko EidenThey look like an ordinary pair of glasses – but these are tech-packed specs.On a Zoom call, Niko Eiden, chief executive and co-founder of Finnish eyewear firm IXI, holds up the frames with lenses containing liquid crystals, meaning their vision-correcting properties can change on the fly.This one pair could correct the vision of someone who normally uses totally different pairs of glasses for seeing near or far.\"These liquid crystals… we can rotate them with an electrical field,\" explains Mr Eiden.\"It's totally, freely tuneable.\" The position of those crystals affects the passage of light through the lenses. A built-in eye-tracker allows the glasses to respond to whatever correction the wearer needs at a given moment.However, tech-laden eyewear has a troubled history – take Google's ill-fated \"Glass\" smart glasses.Consumer acceptability is key, acknowledges Mr Eiden. Most people don't want to look like cyborgs: \"We need to make our products actually look like existing eyewear.\"IXIIXI glasses have lenses that can be manipulated with an electric fieldThe market for eyewear tech is likely to grow. Presbyopia, an age-related condition that makes it harder to focus on things close to you, is projected to become more common over time as the world's population ages. And myopia, or short-sightedness, is also on the rise.Spectacles have remained largely the same for decades. Bifocal lenses – in which a lens is split into two regions, usually for either near- or far-sightedness – require the wearer to direct their vision through the relevant region, depending on what they want to look at, in order to see clearly.Varifocals do a similar job but the transitions are much smoother.In contrast, auto-focus lenses promise to adjust part or all of the lens spontaneously, and even accommodate the wearer's changing eyesight over time.\"The first lenses that we produced were horrible,\" admits Mr Eiden, candidly.Those early prototypes were \"hazy\", he says, and with the lens quality noticeably poor at its edges.But newer versions have proved promising in tests, says Mr Eiden. Participants in the company's trials have been asked, for example, to read something on a page, then look at an object in the distance, to see whether the glasses respond smoothly to the transition.Mr Eiden says that the eye tracking device within the spectacles cannot determine exactly what a wearer is looking at, though certain activities such as reading are in principle detectable because of the nature of eye movements associated with them.Since such glasses respond so closely to the wearer's eye behaviour, it's important the frames fit well, says Emilia Helin, product director.IXI's frames are adjustable but not to a great degree, given the delicate electronics inside, she explains: \"We have some flexibility but not full flexibility.\" That's why IXI hopes to ensure that the small range of frames it has designed would suit a wide variety of faces.The small battery secreted inside IXI's autofocus frames should last for two days, says Mr Eiden, adding that it's possible to recharge the specs overnight while the wearer is asleep.But he won't be drawn on a launch date, which he intends to reveal later this year. As for cost, I ask whether £1,000 might be the sort of price tag he has in mind. He merely says, \"I'm smiling when you say it but I won't confirm.\"Getty ImagesAutofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocalsAutofocus lenses could help people who struggle with varifocals or bifocals, says Paramdeep Bilkhu, clinical adviser at the College of Optometrists.However, he adds, \"There is insufficient evidence to state whether they perform as well as traditional options and whether they can be used for safety critical tasks such as driving.\"Chi-Ho To, an optometry researcher, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University has a similar concern – what if the vision correction went wrong or was delayed slightly while he was, say, performing surgery on someone?\"But I think in terms of general use having something that allows autofocusing is a good idea,\" he adds.Mr Eiden notes that the first version of his company's lenses will not alter the entire lens area. \"One can always glance over the dynamic area,\" he says. If wholly self-adjusting lenses emerge then safety will become \"a much more serious business\", he adds.In 2013, UK firm Adlens released glasses that allowed wearers to manually change the optical power of the lenses via a small dial on the frames. These lenses contained a fluid-filled membrane, which when compressed in response to dial adjustments would alter its curvature.Adlens' current chief executive Rob Stevens says the specs sold for $1,250 (£920) in the US and were \"well received by consumers\" but not so much by opticians, which he says \"strangled sales\".Since then, technology has moved on and the concept of lenses that refocus themselves automatically, without manual interventions, has emerged.Like IXI and other companies, Adlens is working on glasses that do this. However, Mr Stevens declines to confirm a launch date.Joshua Silver, an Oxford University physicist, founded Adlens but no longer works for the company.He came up with the idea of fluid-filled adjustable lenses back in 1985 and developed glasses that could be tuned to the wearer's needs and then permanently set to that prescription.Such lenses have enabled roughly 100,000 people in 20 countries to  access vision correcting technology. Prof Silver is currently seeking investment for a venture called Vision, which would further rollout these glasses.As for more expensive, electronics-filled auto-focus specs, he questions whether they will have broad appeal: \"Wouldn't [people] just go and buy reading glasses, which would more or less do the same thing for them?\"Hong Kong Polytechnic UniversityProf Chi-Ho To has developed a lens which slows short-sightednessOther specs tech is even slowing down the progression of eye conditions such as myopia, beyond just correcting for them.Prof To has developed glasses lenses that have a honeycomb-like ring in them. Light passing through the centre of the ring, focused as normal, reaches the wearer's retina and allows them to see clearly.However, light passing through the ring itself is defocused slightly meaning that the peripheral retina gets a slightly blurred image.This appears to slow improper eyeball growth in children, which Prof To says cuts the rate of short-sightedness progression by 60%. Glasses with this technology are now in use in more than 30 countries, he adds.British firm SightGlass has a slightly different approach – glasses that gently reduce the contrast of someone's vision to similarly affect eye growth and myopia progression.While autofocus glasses and other high-tech solutions may have promise, Prof To has an even bigger goal: glasses that don't just slow down myopia but actually reverse it slightly – a tantalising prospect that could improve the vision of potentially billions of people.\"There is growing evidence that you can do it,\" teases Prof To.More Technology of BusinessThe bridge changing lives and boosting businessShould we be letting flies eat our food waste?Why Ukraine is one of the world's most digital countriesHealthTechnology of BusinessGlassesInternational businessTechnology"

    "content": "Why little Lithuania has big plans for space tech7 July 2025ShareSaveMaryLou CostaTechnology ReporterReporting fromVilnius, LithuaniaShareSaveAstrolightAstrolight is developing a laser-based communications systemI'm led through a series of concrete corridors at Vilnius Tech University, Lithuania; the murals give a Soviet-era vibe, and it seems an unlikely location for a high-tech lab working on a laser communication system.But that's where you'll find the headquarters of Astrolight, a six-year-old Lithuanian space-tech start-up that has just raised €2.8m ($3.3m; £2.4m) to build what it calls an \"optical data highway\".You could think of the tech as invisible internet cables, designed to link up satellites with Earth. With 70,000 satellites expected to launch in the next five years, it's a market with a lot of potential.The company hopes to be part of a shift from traditional radio frequency-based communication, to faster, more secure and higher-bandwidth laser technology.Astrolight's space laser technology could have defence applications as well, which is timely given Russia's current aggressive attitude towards its neighbours. Astrolight is already part of Nato's Diana project (Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic), an incubator, set up in 2023 to apply civilian technology to defence challenges.In Astrolight's case, Nato is keen to leverage its fast, hack-proof laser communications to transmit crucial intelligence in defence operations - something the Lithuanian Navy is already doing.It approached Astrolight three years ago looking for a laser that would allow ships to communicate during radio silence. \"So we said, 'all right - we know how to do it for space. It looks like we can do it also for terrestrial applications',\" recalls Astrolight co-founder and CEO Laurynas Maciulis, who's based in Lithuania's capital, Vilnius.For the military his company's tech is attractive, as the laser system is difficult to intercept or jam.​​It's also about \"low detectability\", Mr Maciulis adds:\"If you turn on your radio transmitter in Ukraine, you're immediately becoming a target, because it's easy to track. So with this technology, because the information travels in a very narrow laser beam, it's very difficult to detect.\"AstrolightAstrolight's system is difficult to detect or jamWorth about £2.5bn, Lithuania's defence budget is small when you compare it to larger countries like the UK, which spends around £54bn a year. But if you look at defence spending as a percentage of GDP, then Lithuania is spending more than many bigger countries.Around 3% of its GDP is spent on defence, and that's set to rise to 5.5%. By comparison, UK defence spending is worth 2.5% of GDP.Recognised for its strength in niche technologies like Astrolight's lasers, 30% of Lithuania's space projects have received EU funding, compared with the EU national average of 17%.\"Space technology is rapidly becoming an increasingly integrated element of Lithuania's broader defence and resilience strategy,\" says Invest Lithuania's Šarūnas Genys, who is the body's head of manufacturing sector, and defence sector expert.Space tech can often have civilian and military uses.Mr Genys gives the example of Lithuanian life sciences firm Delta Biosciences, which is preparing a mission to the International Space Station to test radiation-resistant medical compounds.\"While developed for spaceflight, these innovations could also support special operations forces operating in high-radiation environments,\" he says.He adds that Vilnius-based Kongsberg NanoAvionics has secured a major contract to manufacture hundreds of satellites.\"While primarily commercial, such infrastructure has inherent dual-use potential supporting encrypted communications and real-time intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance across NATO's eastern flank,\" says Mr Genys.BlackSwan SpaceLithuania should invest in its domestic space tech says Tomas MalinauskasGoing hand in hand with Astrolight's laser technology is the autonomous satellite navigation system fellow Lithuanian space-tech start-up Blackswan Space has developed.Blackswan Space's \"vision based navigation system\" allows satellites to be programmed and repositioned independently of a human based at a ground control centre who, its founders say, won't be able to keep up with the sheer volume of satellites launching in the coming years.In a defence environment, the same technology can be used to remotely destroy an enemy satellite, as well as to train soldiers by creating battle simulations.But the sales pitch to the Lithuanian military hasn't necessarily been straightforward, acknowledges Tomas Malinauskas, Blackswan Space's chief commercial officer.He's also concerned that government funding for the sector isn't matching the level of innovation coming out of it.He points out that instead of spending $300m on a US-made drone, the government could invest in a constellation of small satellites. \"Build your own capability for communication and intelligence gathering of enemy countries, rather than a drone that is going to be shot down in the first two hours of a conflict,\" argues Mr Malinauskas, also based in Vilnius.\"It would be a big boost for our small space community, but as well, it would be a long-term, sustainable value-add for the future of the Lithuanian military.\"Space Hub LTEglė Elena Šataitė leads a government agency supporting space techEglė Elena Šataitė is the head of Space Hub LT, a Vilnius-based agency supporting space companies as part of Lithuania's government-funded Innovation Agency. \"Our government is, of course, aware of the reality of where we live, and that we have to invest more in security and defence - and we have to admit that space technologies are the ones that are enabling defence technologies,\" says Ms Šataitė.The country's Minister for Economy and Innovation, Lukas Savickas, says he understands Mr Malinauskas' concern and is looking at government spending on developing space tech. \"Space technology is one of the highest added-value creating sectors, as it is known for its horizontality; many space-based solutions go in line with biotech, AI, new materials, optics, ICT and other fields of innovation,\" says Mr Savickas.Whatever happens with government funding, the Lithuanian appetite for innovation remains strong.\"We always have to prove to others that we belong on the global stage,\" says Dominykas Milasius, co-founder of Delta Biosciences.\"And everything we do is also geopolitical… we have to build up critical value offerings, sciences and other critical technologies, to make our allies understand that it's probably good to protect Lithuania.\"More Technology of BusinessThe British jet engine that failed in the 'Valley of Death'Why we need 'revolutionary' cooling techThe camera tech propelling shows like AdolescenceCommunications satellitesInternational BusinessTechnology of Business"

    "content": "Should we be letting flies eat our food waste?26 June 2025ShareSaveMaryLou CostaTechnology ReporterReporting fromVilnius, LithuaniaShareSaveEnergesmanFly larvae are excellent at converting food waste into proteinMost people are inclined to shoo flies away from food, and the thought of maggots in your bins is enough to make anyone's stomach turn.But a handful of city councils have embraced maggots - more formally known as fly larvae - and their taste for rotting food.In Vilnius, capital of the Baltic state of Lithuania, fly larvae have officially been given the job of processing the 2,700 tonnes of food waste the city's 607,000 residents put out for collection each year, alongside that of the six neighbouring councils.Energesman, the waste management company that began relieving Vilnius of its food waste earlier this year, doesn't actually charge the city for this service.That is saving the city up to €2m (£1.7m; $2.3m) per year, based on a target of processing 12,000 tonnes in 2026 says the company's chief executive, Algirda Blazgys.Energesman has rolled out new orange food waste bags to residents, alongside an influencer marketing campaign to encourage more Vilniečiai to separate their food waste, as the 2,700 tonnes collected is only a fraction of the 40,000 tonnes of household waste the city is thought to generate.Last year it become mandatory for councils to collect food waste, so the city needs to find ways to deal with it. Energesman, meanwhile, has plans to turn the fattened fly larvae into a new income stream.It houses around six million flies in a special zone within its Vilnius plant, who mate around every six hours, according to CEO Algirdas Blazgys.A female fly can lay around 500 eggs in her average 21-day lifespan, so Mr Blazgys and his team are dealing with more than three million larvae a month, who can consume more than 11 tonnes of food waste in the first, hungriest days of their lives.EnergesmanYou can see the new orange bags amongst this pile of Vilnius food wasteIt's the huge appetites of these tiny creatures that make them such excellent candidates for food waste processing. This study shows a swarm of them demolishing a 16 inch pizza in just two hours.The trick is to cull them before they transform into mature flies. That way the protein rich fly larvae can be converted into protein products for use in animal feed or industrial use, for example as an ingredient in paint, glue, lamp shades and furniture covers.Also, their manure, known as frass, can be used as fertiliser.Energesman has already set up supply trials with partners in the paint, glue and furniture industries, but Mr Blazgys acknowledges it's proving more complicated than he anticipated.The sample paint produced using Energesman-reared fly larvae didn't quite come out in the right colour, but the lamp shades created look promising.He also has university partnerships in place to supply fly larvae for research purposes and for feeding bacteria. And of course, the larvae are in demand from the local fishing industry to use as bait. But EU health and safety regulations mean fly larvae fed with kitchen waste can't be used in edible insect products for human consumption, as there could be cross contamination from meat and fish scraps.\"We came up with some crazy ideas, then we started looking for other people that could also come with some crazy ideas about what we could do,\" says Mr Blazgys.\"As it's still very new, some people are still looking to see if we're going to fail, so they don't want to brag about it yet. But I think we're going to come up with something good.\"While there are numerous cases around the world of fly larvae being used in food waste management, and being harvested as a protein ingredient, it's largely on a commercial basis, for example, a private contract between a hotel or apartment building owner and a fly larvae rearer.In Kenya, Project Mila is a social enterprise using fly larvae to tackle Mombasa's mounting food waste problem, while also supplying frass as fertiliser to local farmers.Yet there are just a handful of city councils that have adopted this way of processing food waste.Goterra in Australia has used fly larvae to help Sydney get through its food waste, as part of a limited trial which began this year.For the past three years, Goterra has also been working with three townships that are part of the neighbouring Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council, recycling around 10 tonnes of food waste.FlyboxLarry Kotch hopes UK councils will be allowed to use fly larvae for food wasteWhether we will see UK councils start shipping in millions of flies, so their larvae can munch through the 6.4 million tonnes of household food waste produced here yearly, is only a matter of time.That's the optimistic view of Larry Kotch. He's the CEO and co-founder of insect waste management company Flybox, which he says builds more insect waste processing sites than any other company in the UK, which then work largely with private food manufacturers and supermarkets.Flybox is also a founding member of the Insect Bioconversion Association, an industry body representing companies in the space.UK councils are interested, Mr Kotch believes, especially because weekly household food waste collections will become mandatory in England from March 2026.Around 148 of England's 317 local authorities still don't offer this, according to the Local Authority Recycling Advisory Committee.FlyboxFly larvae can demolish a large pizza in a two hoursBut regulations set by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) are currently barring councils from using fly larvae to process food waste.If regulation could move in line with science, Mr Kotch argues that \"the UK could see its first council-contracted insect plant within two years\".\"Unfortunately, with government it's always safer to say no... Everyone we've spoken to in UK councils are very excited about insect protein and would much rather work with insect farms than alternative technologies.\"DEFRA confirmed to the BBC that the Animal By-Product Regulations restrict insects from being used to process organic waste streams.It says there are currently no plans to review these regulations. \"Our waste management regulations play a crucial role in protecting UK biosecurity and reducing the risk of disease,\" the spokesperson said.The current alternative for sending food waste to landfill is anaerobic digestion (AD), a breakdown process which creates biogas.However, Mr Kotch says current AD plants aren't enough to cope with the anticipated influx of household food waste.\"Globally, over 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted every year. We believe up to 40% of that could be upcycled using insect waste management. And not only does it avoid disposal costs and methane emissions, but it also produces valuable protein and organic fertiliser,\" says Mr Kotch.More Technology of BusinessThe people refusing to use AIDo we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?The British jet engine that failed in the 'Valley of Death'International businessLithuaniaClimateFood wasteTechnology of Business"

I don't, but you can certainly expect different types of game experiences than you've seen so far on mobile,\" he says.Mr Paananen underlines the need for innovation with a statistic; last year 60% of the time spent on mobile games was accounted for by games that were at least six years old, and only 10% of playing time was on titles developed in the past year.And without exciting new games, the industry will struggle for attention.\"The competition for people's free time is so much tougher these days. And not only are you competing against other games, but you're competing against social media, music streaming, video streaming, etc, all available on your mobile phone,\" he says.One reason the industry is not churning out games, he says, is the expense. In the early days,  mobile games were simpler and cheaper to make than games played on consoles and PCs. But not anymore.\"Building games has actually become a lot more expensive,\" says Mr Paananen. \"The main reason is that the platform [smartphones] enables you to do way more today than 10 years ago. And the other thing is that the kind of a bar is just way higher in consumers' minds.\"supercellSquad Busters has not matched Supercell's previous big hitsSupercell's own production line has stumbled. Launched last year, Squad Busters had a strong start, but has faded since then.\"The truth is that it hasn't met our ambition, at least not yet,\" admits Mr Paananen.In February, Supercell appointed a new general manager to Squad Busters.\"The team has made some really, really bold changes to the game. And of course, time will tell,\" Mr Paananen says.Supercell has taken a different approach with another new game, Mo.co. The monster hunting game was launched in March, but only to those with an invite from Supercell.\"It's hard to measure what they consider to be a success with that one... it's still invite only and hasn't really set the world on fire,\" says Neil Long, the founder and editor of mobilegamer.biz, and who has been a video games journalist for more than 20 years.\"Mobile games are quite an extreme business, where the successes are really big, but also the failures are really, really big,\" he says.He points to last month's decision by games maker Activision to pull Call of Duty: Warzone.\"They would have spent years developing this game, and then they launched, it didn't work, and it's dead within a year... that's why people aren't taking risks, because, you know, the failures are very visible and costly.\"He also points out that the mobile games industry has changed a lot in the years since Supercell launched its hit games. There's much more competition and some developers are choosing not to make a big, splashy launch, and instead tweak games on the go. \"Maybe the era of these mega launches is kind of over,\" says Mr Long.\"Sometimes it's better to put your game out there and then just sort of build it as you go and learn what players like and don't like,\" he says. ActivisionActivision abandoned its mobile game Call of Duty WarzoneSupercell gives a lot of independence to the teams that are working on new games. At the moment there are 10 of them with games in various stages of development.One of their guiding principles is to create games with longevity. \"The question that our teams ask themselves is: 'Why would people play this game in five or 10 years?'.\"\"They'd love to be in the same class of companies like, say, Nintendo, for example. It's been around more than 100 years.\"Mr Long says at the core of Supercells' success is a simple principle.\"They take quite complex game ideas and make them really easy and accessible to play, and sort of cartoony and fun.\"SupercellClash of Clans was launched in 2012Like many businesses, Mr Paananen is hopeful that AI will help spur innovation. At Supercell it's being used to create new types of games.\"I've seen some internal prototypes, but it's super early. I think it's going to take a few years for somebody to invent something completely new on that front.\"But it's one of those things where it's not a question of if it's going to happen. It's question of when it's going to happen and who will make it happen.\"Supercell also has its AI Innovation Lab in Helsinki. It's a chance for people external to the company to experiment with Supercell's intellectual property, including its games and characters. \"We basically gave them a free hand to do whatever they wanted, in order to spark innovation. Mr Paananen says it's been a \"massive success\" and another is planned for San Francisco.\"The end result might not even be a game, or a game that you and I would think about as a game, but it's completely different experience enabled by AI.\"Mr Long says AI has been useful in specific areas, like speeding up game development or analysing player behaviour.But so far nothing revolutionary.\"In terms of creating entirely new types of games we've yet to see it. And it doesn't feel like it's about to happen just yet, but we'll see.\"More Technology of BusinessWhy Ukraine is one of the world's most digital countriesFrom festivals to weddings: Why drone shows are boomingThe British jet engine that failed in the 'Valley of Death'GamingInternational BusinessTechnology of Business"

    "content": "Tech giants unleash AI on weather forecasts: are they any good?Image source, NASAImage caption, Hurricane Florence viewed from the International Space StationChris Fawkes Lead Weather PresenterPublished20 June 2025A wave of machine-learning weather models have been unleashed by some of the very biggest businesses on the planet.These challenge the orthodoxy of traditional physics-based computer forecasts that have been incrementally developed and improved over many decades. But are the machine learning models any good? The weather is a national obsession for us Brits, and it is no wonder given the huge changes that are seen and felt from one day to the next.Accurate weather forecasts are not just vital for planning our daily lives but knowing about upcoming severe weather can help us to change our behaviour, save lives and mitigate damage to property.It is impossible to assess the full economic value of weather forecasts globally, but the numbers are huge. According to NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), in the US alone - and just taking into account the biggest weather disasters that caused over $1bn (£740m) in damage - the fallout from severe weather in 2024 amounted to $182bn, with 568 fatalities.Since 1980, this damage figure stands at nearly $3tn.Meanwhile, in the UK, there were 1,311 excess deaths caused by heatwaves in 2024.A study from consultants, external, London Economics, concluded that the Met Office would bring £56bn of benefits to the UK economy over the course of a decade through providing meteorological services. Multiply these kinds of numbers across the whole world, with a growing population exposed to increasingly extreme weather fuelled by climate change, and weather is big business.Image source, EPAImage caption, Trying to keep cool during a heatwaveThe biggest computers on the planetTraditional weather forecasts are produced on some of the biggest supercomputers on the planet; the Met Office super computing contract is worth £1.2bn. That huge sum of money buys you a machine that can perform 60 quadrillion (60,000,000,000,000,000) calculations per second, running a model containing the understood physics, with over a million lines of code and using 215 billion weather observations. Global weather models work by crunching the numbers in a grid of boxes right around the planet. The size or resolution of these boxes varies across different meteorological models, but range between about 10sq km to 28sq km (3.86sq miles to 10.81sq miles).At this kind of resolution they cannot accurately predict showers, while mountain ranges are lower and smoother than in the real world. The highest resolution model from the Met Office, the UKV (the model that runs BBC TV graphics for the first 48 hours) can predict showers with its incredible 1.5km (0.9 mile) resolution - but it takes so much computing time and power that this model is not able to forecast for the entire world; instead it concentrates on the UK and Europe.Machine-learning weather models: are they any good?Machine-learning weather models have only been around for a few years, showing promise as they develop rapidly. Traditional models take hours to run on hugely expensive supercomputers, however this new breed of models can take less than a minute to run on a standard laptop. They don't need to know all the 'burdensome'  laws of physics, but are instead trained on 40 years of past data to make their predictions.How do they perform? Well let's look at forecast verification data from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium Range weather Forecasting) for atmospheric pressure patterns in winter 2024/2025, external.GraphCast (Google), AIFS (ECMWF) and Aurora (Microsoft) were more accurate than the traditional IFS (ECMWF) benchmark forecast, whereas FourCastNet (Nvidia) and Pangu-Weather (Huawei) trailed behind.So some of the machine-learning models performed better, and some worse, but it depends on which variable you look at, and all of this could change quickly as the rate of progress accelerates. Just like traditional models, AI models are less accurate the further ahead in the future they're trying to predict - a consequence of the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. Looking 10 days ahead, none of the AI models (or traditional models) were able to offer forecasts considered to be of much use in terms of accuracy.    So is it time to walk away from physics-based weather models? Not yet.Machine-learning weather models are not only trained using data produced by traditional weather models, but they also use the start position of the atmosphere from traditional models as their input point. In other words, without those traditional models running, the machine-learning models wouldn't work as well.All machine-learning models can forecast large scale features like high and low pressure six days ahead very well, but they can underperform compared to traditional models at smaller-scales of 1000km or less.This means that important features like troughs and ridges could be missed, which would make the difference between a dry day, or a day with heavy rain.Image source, PA MediaImage caption, The aftermath of the Boscastle floods, Cornwall, in August 2004The majority of machine learning models have a resolution of 28sq km, which is the same scale as the data that they've trained on. This means small features like showers would most likely be missed, so they wouldn't be able to forecast a Boscastle flood event many days ahead.News headlines have claimed that these new models are better than traditional models at predicting hurricanes. It may be true that some have been a little better at predicting the landfall of hurricanes ahead of traditional models, but at the same time they have been very poor at predicting the wind strength and therefore the likely damage the storm would bring. This may be the result of the smoothing, or averaging effect of looking at lots of hurricanes in the 40 years of training data.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines was the second largest of the 20th CenturyAI models may struggle to forecast effects from rare events that have not been seen often in the 40 years of training data. An example of this is the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo that cooled the planet down by up to 0.5C for two years.There are also questions about how well AI models will forecast in a warmer world as our planet continues to heat up as a result of climate change. The past climate that they've trained on will look quite different to our future climate, as greenhouse gases continue to accumulate in the atmosphere.So, where will we be in five years time?\"I think we'll have traditional models running alongside AI models so that we are drawing on their combined strengths to enable hyper-localised accurate forecasts, delivered fast, when you need them,\" says Professor Kirstine Dale, chief AI officer at the Met Office. Machine-learning models haven't been around for very long, but with their speed, computer efficiency and rapid rate of development, they show great potential.

It was day one of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and Russian saboteurs were fighting with Ukrainian security forces in the centre of the Ukrainian capital.\"There is shooting, cars are burning, armoured vehicles are burning... when we eventually passed... there were a lot of bodies.\"As a government minister he had been ordered to drive hundreds of kilometres west and continue his work in a safer location. Beginning in 2019, Bornykov, Deputy Minister of Digital Transformation, had been managing the shift of Ukraine's government services to a new app called Diia (the Ukrainian word for action).The idea was that citizens could access everything they needed from their mobile phones; driving licences, marriage certificates, house deeds, and much more. They started with driver's licences in 2019, which was quite popular, but the Diia app got a boost during the pandemic, when Covid certificates were added. \"This gave another maybe two or three million people,\" says Bornykov.Despite the war Diia has continued to develop.Today the app hosts 40 government services, including tax payment, car registration and marriage applications. Perhaps more fun - Ukrainians can make local selections for Eurovision via the app, including selecting national jury members and choosing the national representative. Additionally, 30 documents are available on the app; Bornykov, flicked through some of his for me including his gun licence and car insurance. There is also a Diia portal, which can be accessed via a browser on a computer, which has 130 services for citizens and businesses.In total Diia has 22.7 million users.All this, according to Bornyakov, makes Ukraine one of the leading countries when it comes to digital government services - in his opinion putting Ukraine ahead of Estonia, which is well known for its digital government.\"I haven't seen anybody else doing better than us, except maybe Saudi Arabia, and this both relates to number of users and and the approach.\"Ministry of Digital Transformation UkraineMarriage admin can all be done via the Diia appHow has Ukraine been able to make such progress, despite the disruption of Covid and amid, for the last three years, fighting off Russian invaders?Part of it is having the right workforce, according to Bornyakov. He says that for the past 20 years Ukraine has been a popular destination for companies looking to outsource IT projects. He estimates that there are 300,000 software developers in Ukraine, many of whom have worked on complex projects for big international companies. \"There's a lot of technical and experienced engineers that can do brilliant things,\" he says.They are also not as expensive as elsewhere in the world. So, he estimates that between five and 10 million dollars was spent on developing Diia. Hiring software developers in the UK would cost five or 10 times as much, he says. Getty ImagesThe Diia app was used to select Ukraine's Eurovision act, ZiferblatDavid Eaves is associate professor of digital government at University College London, and has studied efforts by governments all over the world to digitise their services.He says the key to Ukraine's success was work done prior to building the app. Using software similar to that used by Estonia, Ukraine created a data exchange, which made it easy for data flow from government departments and organisations. The Diia app was then added on top of the data exchange.\"If you have this flexibility of moving data around, it becomes much easier to build new services, because rather than asking citizens for the same information all over again, you can simply request their permission to access it,\" says Prof Eaves.So, when applying for a benefit, users don't have to re-enter their address, place of birth, martial status, and their income could be checked against their tax records. Not only does this reduce the administrative burden, but it means the government doesn't have to design a system to recollect, store and process this information all over again.Ministry for Digital Transformation UkraineThe Diia app hosts 40 government services and 30 documentsThat flexibility allowed Ukraine to add new services to cope with the challenges of war.\"We actually introduced around 15 different services related to the to the war,\" says Mr Bornyakov.For example users could apply for compensation if their property was damaged or destroyed. Citizens could also report the location of Russian troops through the app.Prof Eaves also points out that Ukraine's war with Russia has spurred government to modernise.\"When you are on a wartime footing, there's a sense of urgency. The urgency of delivering the service becomes more important than rules that sometimes trip up bureaucracies,\" he says.That's put Ukraine among the countries leading the effort to digitise government services, according to Prof Eaves.He thinks Denmark is probably leading the way with both a solid infrastructure, range of services and well designed user interface.So what does the future hold? Ukraine is developing AI systems which Bornyakov says have the potential to make interactions with government smoother.He sees AI guiding a user through the various steps to get what they want.\"We want to redefine the approach to government services,\" he says.While Prof Eaves is excited about the possibility of AI in government services, he advises caution.Developers need to be sure they have reliable data to train the AI and then ensure the system can learn what the right answers are.\"AI is like having a Ferrari. You can do amazing things, but you better have good roads.

Mrs Underwood's mother had arranged the surprise drone show with help from the couple's wedding planner – who had suggested it as a \"wow factor\" component of the day. It seemed to have the desired effect.\"It was kind of just shock – 'Is this really happening right now?',\" says Mrs Underwood. \"I can't believe my mom did this for us.\"Chris J EvansDrones traced out a baseball player for the Underwood's weddingDrone shows are becoming ever more popular. Once rarities, they are now appearing at occasions ranging from birthday parties and weddings, to major sporting events. Some theme parks even have resident drone shows that take place multiple nights in a row.Glastonbury music festival had its first drone show in 2024, flown by UK-based drone show company, Celestial. And record-breaking displays are pushing the technology to its limits – the biggest drone show in history took place in China last October. It featured a total of 10,200 drones and broke a record set only the previous month. So, does all this spell the end for fireworks?\"They are really beautiful – they are art,\" says Sally French, a US-based drone industry commentator known as The Drone Girl. She says that drone shows have appeared at baseball games, corporate conferences, and even at ports, to celebrate the launch of cruises.Drone displays are becoming highly sophisticated, she explains, with some drone shows featuring thousands of flying devices, allowing them to animate figures or patterns in incredible detail.\"I saw a Star Wars-themed drone show where there was a full-on lightsabre battle,\" adds Ms French.One barrier might be the price tag, however, with the cost per drone at around $300 (£220) in the UK, says Ms French, citing industry data from drone show software firm SPH Engineering: \"A 500 drone show would be over $150,000.\"Mrs Underwood does not have an exact figure, but estimates that her wedding drone show cost tens of thousands of dollars.The Drone GirlSally French says drone shows have become an art formThe sky's the limit, actually. Skymagic, one of the world's largest drone show companies, has put on major displays that cost north of $1m says Patrick O'Mahony, co-founder and creative director.Skymagic's shows have taken place in various countries – including the 2023 Coachella music festival in California.The company has also performed drone shows in the UK, including as part of the King's Coronation concert, which was broadcast by the BBC.Mr O'Mahony has worked with designers of fireworks displays and other, similar events. But drones have revolutionised outdoor public displays, he says.His company has a fleet of 6,000 custom-designed drones. Each one can reach speeds of up to 10 meters per second. The drones sport LED lights and have batteries that allow for 25 minutes of flight time.To make them easier to transport, the drones are stored in flight cases and unpacked at venues in a giant marquee before they are laid out in the take-off area, half a metre apart, in a grid pattern.\"Once the drones have received their 'go' command [they] fly the entire show,\" adds Mr O'Mahony, explaining that a single human pilot on the ground controls thousands of the devices at once.The drones are geo-fenced, based on Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which prevents them from straying beyond the allotted flight area. In windy conditions, though, they can get blown off course. In such cases, they automatically return to a landing spot on the ground, says Mr O'Mahony.SkymagicPatrick O'Mahony's company has a fleet of 6,000 dronesFireworks have a \"boom\" factor that drones generally don't, notes Ms French. However, Bill Ray, an analyst at market research firm Gartner, says that some drones can now launch pyrotechnics, for a firework-like effect. For instance, a stream of sparks raining down from the lower portion of an image created by a group of drones.Plus, Mr Ray says it is much easier to accurately synchronise drone movements with music during a show, which could be another reason behind their appeal. But the cost of shows remains prohibitive to some, and in part comes down to the fact that laying out the devices and gathering them all up again after the performance is still a relatively slow, manual process, adds Mr Ray.Pedro Rosário is chief executive of Drone Show Animations, a company that designs drone show performances for other companies that supply the drones themselves. Mr Rosário says that one challenging aspect of his work is in coming up with displays that adhere to various regulations applying to drone flights, since these rules differ from country to country. England has stricter regulations than countries in the Middle East, for example, he says.Mr Rosário adds that drone shows, which might be paired with pyrotechnics, traditional fireworks or even lasers, allow for a huge degree of creative freedom: \"You can really build something that has emotional value, it can tell a story.\"In Mrs Underwood's case, that seems to have worked. Her guests enjoyed the spectacle too, she adds: \"We've heard compliments about our wedding in general – but, consistently, the drone show is something people bring up as something they never expected to see.\"More Technology of BusinessThe people refusing to use AIWho will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?Do we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?Technology of BusinessInternational business"

    "content": "How airline fees have turned baggage into billions4 June 2025ShareSaveSam GruetBusiness reporterReporting fromTorontoShareSaveGetty ImagesAirlines in the US alone made $7.27bn from check-in luggage fees last yearWith Air Canada and Southwest the latest airlines to charge passengers for check-in luggage, the ballooning cost of such ancillary or \"junk fees\" is provoking anger among politicians and consumer groups. At the same time, sales of suitcases small enough for passengers to take on the plane as hand luggage are booming.Standing outside Toronto's downtown airport, Lauren Alexander has flown over from Boston for the weekend. She describes such additional charges as \"ridiculous\".\"It feels like a trick,\" says the 24-year-old. \"You buy the ticket, you think it's going to be less expensive, then you have to pay $200 (£148) extra [to bring a suitcase].\"To avoid the fee, Ms Alexander instead travelled with a small backpack as hand luggage.Sage Riley, who is 27, agrees, telling the BBC, \"It can be pricey.\"There was a time when checked bags, seat selection and your meals all came as standard on commercial flights. But that all changed with the rise of the budget airlines, says Jay Sorensen of US aviation consultancy IdeaWorks.It was in 2006 when UK low-cost carrier FlyBe became what is believed to be the world's first airline to start charging passengers to check in bags. It charged £2 for a pre-booked item of luggage, and £4 if the customer hadn't paid in advance. Other budget carriers then quickly followed suit, with the so-called flag carriers or established airlines then also doing so, at least on shorter flights.In 2008 American Airlines became the first US airline to charge a fee, $15, for the first checked bag on its domestic routes.Mr Sorenson says such traditional airlines felt they had no choice when they \"began to realise that the low-cost carriers were providing very significant competition\". He adds: \"They felt they had to do something to meet that.\"Getty ImagesUS carrier Southwest now charges passengers to check in bags on domestic flightsFast forward to today, and US airlines alone made $7.27bn from check-in baggage fees last year, according to federal figures. That is up from $7bn in 2023, and $5.76bn in 2019.Little wonder then that more of us are trying to just take carry-on. Kirsty Glenn, managing director of UK luggage firm Antler, confirms that there is an ongoing surge in demand for small suitcases that meet airline dimension limits for carry-on luggage.\"We have seen huge spikes in searches online and on our website,\" she says. Describing a new small-dimension case her company launched in April, Ms Glenn adds: \"Testament to the trend of only travelling with hand luggage, it's sold like crazy.\"At the same time, social media content about travel packing \"hacks\" and luggage that meets airlines' carry-on size measurements, have soared according to travel journalist Chelsea Dickenson. She makes this content for TikTok.\"Social media has really propelled this idea of needing a bag that fits the baggage allowance requirements, says Ms Dickenson. \"It's become a core part of the content that I create and post on social media.\"Ms Dickenson, whose social media following has ballooned to close to a million followers, adds that her luggage videos have become a \"core part of the content\" she creates.\"It blows my mind,\" she says. \"I could spend weeks and weeks researching a big trip, and the resulting videos will not come close to doing as well as me going and buying a cheap suitcase, taking it to the airport, testing it in one of those baggage sizes and reporting back.\"BBC Business Daily - Why sales of carry-on luggage are boomingThe overall global cost of all airline extra fees, from luggage to seat selection, buying wifi access, lounge access, upgrades, and food and drink, is expected to reach $145bn this year, 14% of the sector's total revenues. That's according to the International Air Transport Association, which represents the industry. This compares with $137bn last year.These numbers have caught the attention of some politicians in Washington, and last December airline bosses were grilled before a senate committee. It was a Democrat senator who used the term \"junk fees\".  He wants the federal government to review such costs and potentially fine airlines. We asked the US Department of Transportation for a comment, but did not get a response.Chelsea DickensonChelsea Dickenson posts videos where she checks if bags are below airline's size limitsBut if having to pay for check-in wasn't enough, a growing number of airlines are now charging for hand luggage. For example, Irish budget airline Ryanair will only allow you to carry a small bag that fits under the seat in front of you for free. If you want to take a bigger bag or suitcase to go in the overhead locker that will cost you from £6.Other European airlines that now have similar charges for hand luggage are Easyjet, Norwegian Airlines, Transavia, Volotea, Vueling, and Wizzair.This has annoyed pan-European consumer group BEUC (The European Consumer Organisation), which last month filed a complaint with the European Commission.BEUC cites a 2014 EU Court of Justice ruling, which said \"carriage of hand baggage cannot be made subject to a price supplement, provided that it meets reasonable requirements in terms of its weight and dimensions, and complies with applicable security requirements\".However, what determines \"reasonable requirements\" continues to be a grey area in need of an official ruling.There can, however, be a different way of doing things, as shown by Indian airline IndiGo. Its boss Pieter Eibers says that it does not charge for check-in luggage.\"The entire philosophy here is different,\" he says. \"We don't want long lines, and endless debates at gates about the weight of luggage. We don't have any of that. We turn our planes around in 35 minutes.\"Read more global business storiesChile's salmon farms hope for calmer watersWinemakers finding Trump's tariffs hard to swallowDid Trump really strike Gulf deals worth $2tn?Is the US finally on track to build a high-speed rail network?Southwest AirlinesWorld of BusinessInternational BusinessTravelTransportAir travel"

This was a futuristic space plane that caught the public imagination with the prospect of a British aircraft flying beyond the atmosphere.The secret sauce of Hotol was heat exchanger technology, an attempt to cool the super-heated 1,000C air that enters an engine at hypersonic speeds.Without cooling this will melt aluminium, and is, Mr Varvill says, \"literally too hot to handle\".Fast forward three decades to October 2024 and Reaction Engines was bringing the heat exchanger to life at sites in the UK and US.UK Ministry of Defence funding took the company into hypersonic research with Rolls-Royce for an unmanned aircraft. But that was not enough to keep the business afloat.Rolls-Royce declines to go into details about Reaction's collapse, but Mr Varvill is more specific.\"Rolls-Royce said it had other priorities and the UK military has very little money.\"Richard VarvillRichard Varvill: \"Just as we were getting close to succeeding we failed\"Aviation is a business with a very long gestation time for a product. It can take 20 years to develop an aircraft. This unforgiving journey is known as crossing the Valley of Death.Mr Varvill knew the business had to raise more funds towards the end of 2024 but big investors  were reluctant to jump on board.\"The game was being played right to the very end, but to cross the Valley of Death in aerospace is very hard.\"What was the atmosphere like in those last days as the administrators moved in?\"It was pretty grim, we were all called into the lecture theatre and the managing director gave a speech about how the board 'had tried everything'. Then came the unpleasant experience of handing over passes and getting personal items. It was definitely a bad day at the office.\"This bad day was too much for some. \"A few people were in tears. A lot of them were shocked and upset because they'd hoped we could pull it off right up to the end.\"It was galling for Mr Varvill \"because we were turning it around with an improved engine. Just as we were getting close to succeeding we failed. That's a uniquely British characteristic.\"Reaction Engines LtdReaction developed a way of chilling air from 1,000C for use in a jet engineDid they follow the traditional path after a mass lay-off and head to the nearest pub? \"We had a very large party at my house. Otherwise it would have been pretty awful to have put all that effort into the company and not mark it in some way.\"His former colleague Kathryn Evans headed up the space effort, the work around hypersonic flight for the Ministry of Defence and opportunities to apply the technology in any other commercial areas.When did she know the game was up? \"It's tricky to say when I knew it was going wrong, I was very hopeful to the end. While there was a lot of uncertainty there was a strong pipeline of opportunities.\"She remembers the moment the axe fell and she joined 200 colleagues in the HQ's auditorium.\"It was the 31st of October, a Thursday, I knew it was bad news but when you're made redundant with immediate effect there's no time to think about it. We'd all been fighting right to the end so then my adrenalin crashed.\"And those final hours were recorded. One of her colleagues brought in a Polaroid camera. Portrait photos were taken and stuck on a board with message expressing what Reaction Engines meant to individuals.What did Ms Evans write? \"I will very much miss working with brilliant minds in a kind, supportive culture.\"Since then she's been reflecting \"on an unfinished mission and the technology's potential\".But her personal pride remains strong. \"It was British engineering at its best and it's important for people to hold their heads up high.\"Her boss Adam Dissel, president of Reaction Engines, ran the US arm of the business. He laments the unsuccessful struggle to wrest more funds from big names in aerospace.\"The technology consistently worked and was fairly mature. But some of our strategic investors weren't excited enough to put more money in and that put others off.\"The main investors were Boeing, BAE Systems and Roll-Royce. He feels they could have done more to give the wider investment community confidence in Reaction Engines.It would have avoided a lot of pain. \"My team had put heart and soul into the company and we had a good cry. \"Did they really shed tears? \"Absolutely, I had my tears at our final meeting where we joined hands and stood up. I said 'We still did great, take a bow.\"What lessons can we draw for other high-tech ventures? \"You definitely have no choice but to be optimistic,\" says Mr Dissel.The grim procedure of winding down the business took over as passwords and laptops were collected while servers were backed up in case \"some future incarnation of the business can be preserved\".The company had been going in various guises for 35 years. \"We didn't want it to go to rust. I expect the administrator will look for a buyer for the intellectual property assets,\" Mr Dissel adds.Other former employees also hold out for a phoenix rising from the ashes. But the Valley of Death looms large.\"Reaction Engines was playing at the very edge of what was possible. We were working for the fastest engines and highest temperatures. We bit off the hard job,\" says Mr Dissel.Despite all this Mr Varvill's own epitaph for the business overshadows technological milestones. \"We failed because we ran out of money.\"More Technology of BusinessWhy we need 'revolutionary' cooling techThe camera tech propelling shows like AdolescenceHow to avoid a puncture on the MoonInternational BusinessTechnology of Business"

It is waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production.The fate of the subsidies is part of a sweeping budget bill currently under consideration by the Senate.A version of the legislation passed by the lower house cuts the hydrogen tax credit, amongst others, and scales back more.The clean hydrogen tax credit would help reduce the cost of the American technology going into the facility, and aide in competing with Chinese e-methanol producers, says Lee Beck, HIF Global's senior vice president for global policy and commercial strategy.\"The goal is not to be dependent on tax credits over the long run, but to get the project started.\"Ms Beck can't say yet what the outcome for the Matagorda facility will be if the tax credit is ultimately killed, except that it will make things hard – and the US isn't the only location the company operates in.HIFHIF Global has a demonstration e-fuel producing facility in Punta Arenas, ChileThe Trump administration has been particularly hostile to green energy.Amongst the President's actions since taking office in January include initiating the US's withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement and temporarily suspending renewable energy projects on federal lands (he has a particular disdain for wind power).Trump has also directed agencies to pause Green New Deal funds, which he regularly calls \"Green New Scam\" funds: grants and loans being made under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), enacted under Biden's presidency in 2021 and 2022 respectively.Those grants and loans, together with the clean energy tax credits that are also part of the IRA, have been funnelling billions of new federal and private dollars into developing clean energy. \"It is tumultuous time,\" says Adie Tomer, of the Brookings Institution, a think tank. \"We are doing the exact opposite of our developed world peers.\"Court battles are ongoing over the President's order to pause green funding, which might ultimately end up in the Supreme Court. In the meantime, agencies are conducting their own reviews and making their own decisions.Getty ImagesGreen energy firms are watching developments on the budget billJessie Stolark, executive director of the Carbon Capture Coalition, which represents companies involved in carbon capture and storage, laments the lack of clarity from the administration.Members, she explains, have won project funding under the IIJA – including, for example, to build direct air capture facilities. But while projects generally have been able to access funds already awarded to earlier phases, it is unclear if they will be able to progress to additional phases where additional funds are supposed to be made available.\"It is causing uncertainty, which is really bad for project deployment,\" says Ms Stolark. \"If you endanger the success of these first-of-a-kind projects it just takes the wind out of the sails of the whole [carbon management] industry long term.\"Meanwhile, the fate of the IRA, which the Congress has the power to amend or repeal along with the IIJA, is being decided, in part, by the budget bill, which aims to permanently extend President Trump's first term tax cuts by making savings elsewhere.What exactly will remain of the Federal green energy agenda when both the House and Senate agree a compromise version remains to be seen.It seems likely the IRA's tax credits, which are generally scheduled to expire at the end of 2032, though some extend beyond that date, will take a heavy hit, even if the IRA dodges the bullet of outright repeal.Also marked for termination include the tax credits for consumers buying EVs and making their homes more efficient.Many others, such as those for producing clean electricity and manufacturing clean energy components like wind turbine parts, solar panels and batteries, would be phased out earlier or made harder and less worthwhile to secure.That many of the projects set to benefit from the tax credits are in Republican areas seems to have had little sway in the House, notes Ashur Nissan of policy advice firm Kaya Partners.But critics say that the Biden green energy initiatives are too expensive.The IRA's energy tax credits are \"multiple times\" larger than initial estimates, and expose American taxpayers to \"potentially unlimited liability\" noted a recent report from the libertarian Cato Institute advocating their full repeal.Meanwhile, actual clean energy investment in the US including from both government and private sources (the far larger share) dropped 3.8% in the first quarter of 2025 to $67.3bn, a second quarterly decline, according to new figures released by the Clean Investment Monitor.\"Momentum is sagging a bit which is a little concerning,\" says Hannah Hess of the Rhodium Group research firm, which partners with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to produce it. She attributes the trend to a mix of high inflation, high interest rates, global supply chain issues and uncertainty in the policy environment created by the new administration.There was also, she observes, a record number of clean energy manufacturing projects cancelled in the first quarter of 2025 – six projects mostly in batteries and representing $6.9bn in investment– though it is difficult to say to what extent the new administration was a driver.More worrying to Ms Hess is the decline since the last quarter in announcements for some types of new projects, which she believes can be \"more strongly\" attributed to the policy situation, with companies lacking confidence there will be demand for the clean products their projects would produce.HeirloomFirms that capture CO2 from the air have won government fundingTariffs, which will increase factory construction costs if components need to be imported, are an extra factor that may negatively influence project decisions going forward, notes Anthony DeOrsey of the Cleantech Group research and consulting firm.Investment aside, companies are also making shifts in how they market their products.The homepage of LanzaJet – which produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from ethanol – used to emphasise how scaling SAF could \"meet the urgent moment of climate change\". It now focusses on its potential to \"harness the energy of locally produced feedstocks\".SAF has never been about just one thing, notes CEO Jimmy Samartzis. Tailoring messaging to be \"relevant to the stakeholders we are engaging with\" makes sense.The company is current waiting on a $3m grant it was awarded by the Federal Aviation Authority last August as part of a nearly $300m program designed to help aviation transition to SAF and which was funded under the IRA.\"It is approved funding, but it is stuck at this point,\" says Mr Samartzis.How to avoid a puncture on the MoonThe people refusing to use AIThe camera tech propelling shows like AdolescenceWorld of BusinessInternational BusinessTechnology of Business"

He named it MittiCool or the clay that stays cool.At $95 its affordable and now sold through 300 stores in India and exported to countries including the UK, Kenya, and UAE.\"Fridges are a dream for many poor families,\" Mr Prajapati says. \"And such dreams should be within reach.\"MittiCoolThe affordable MittiCool fridge is made from clayMr Prajapati's innovation is part of a growing wave of grassroots entrepreneurship in India, driven by necessity.Prof Anil Gupta who runs the Honeybee Network, a platform for supporting such ventures, call these \"frugal innovations\".\"It is a mindset,\" says Prof Gupta.\"Frugal innovation is about making solutions affordable, accessible, and available. Many of these innovators don't have formal education but are solving real world problems.\"It's difficult to put a number on such businesses, as there has never been an in-depth study.Prof Gupta says such start-ups are crucial because they provide jobs in rural areas and start a cycle of economic change.For example, Mr Prajapati now employs 150 people in his workshop and has branched out into cookware, clay water filters and is experimenting with homes made of clay.Bijayshanti TongbramBotanist turned entrepreneur Bijayshanti Tongbram shows the fibres in lotus stemsAnother start-up that's hoping for similar success, is run by Bijayshanti Tongbram in the northeastern state of Manipur.She lives in Thanga village which is home to one of India's largest freshwater lakes, Loktak.Here lotus flowers bloom in abundance.\"People in my village use the petals of lotus flowers for religious offerings. But their stems often go to waste and that's what I wanted to change and thought of doing something sustainable,\" she says.A botanist by profession, Ms Tongbram developed a way to extract silk-like fibres from the lotus stems and now leads a team of 30 women in her village who spin the threads into a yarn and weaves them into unique scarves and garments.\"It takes two months, and 9,000 lotus stems to make one scarf,\" she says.Ms Tongbram pays the women $80 a month.\"This isn't just about fashion. I am giving women in my village a chance to do something other than fishing and earn money,\" she says.Like many small business owners, she wants to scale-up and find new markets, perhaps overseas.\"Funding is the biggest challenge,\" she says.Bijayshanti TongbramFibres can be extracted from lotus stems to make a yarnProf Gupta from the Honeybee network agrees.\"There are government schemes and small grants, but rural entrepreneurs often don't  know how to access them.\"Even venture capitalists who are looking at IT innovations rarely invest in these kinds of start-ups because of high transaction costs,\" he says.Nevertheless, innovators continue to spring up.In Karanataka's Vijaynagar, Girish Badragond is working on a device to help blind and partially-sighted farmers.His device, described as a smart farming stick, uses soil sensors and weather data to guide its users about the crop conditions and harvests through audio messages and vibrations.\"There are so many blind people in India who want to farm but they can't trust others to guide them. This will help them become independent and empower them,\" says Mr Badragond.He has sourced mechanical parts from different shops and is hoping to gain support for commercialising his project soon. For now, he is doing rounds of government exhibitions.\"It's a prototype but I am hopeful that people will support me to change lives of others,\" he says.More Technology of BusinessWhy we need 'revolutionary' cooling techThe camera tech propelling shows like AdolescenceHow to avoid a puncture on the MoonInternational BusinessIndiaTechnology of Business"

    "content": "Why we need 'revolutionary' cooling tech19 May 2025ShareSaveChristine RoTechnology ReporterShareSaveGetty ImagesClimate change is making staying cool more challengingSneha Sachar, who spent half her life in Delhi and now lives in California, is used to heat. But her hometown feels much hotter now than when she was growing up.Even commuting by car is so uncomfortable in certain months, says Ms Sachar, who works for the Clean Cooling Collaborative, a philanthropic initiative focused on improved cooling.Rising temperatures are even worse for outdoor workers. \"This is really impacting the ability of people to continue to earn their livelihoods,\" Ms Sachar says.She says that there are a number of low-tech ways to keep buildings cool, such as designing for air flow.For outdoor workers, even a 20-minute break from the heat and humidity, such as in well-designed cooling stations, can make a difference.But beyond this, active cooling will become increasingly critical as temperatures continue to rise due to climate change.Morgan Stanley is predicting that the annual growth rate of the cooling market, already worth $235bn (£180bn) a year, could more than double by 2030.Getty ImagesTraditional cooling uses refrigerants which can leakYet existing cooling devices have serious drawbacks. One issue the refrigerant - the fluid that transitions back and forth from liquid to gas, in a process that transfers heat.It's common for them to leak from standard systems, harming both efficiency and potentially health.The refrigerants typically used in cooling today are hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), a group of synthetic gases with high global warming potential. HFCs are much more potent than carbon dioxide.So one option is to replace the refrigerants with more climate-friendly versions. But the candidates with the lower global warming potential, also have problems. For instance, propane is highly flammable. Ammonia is toxic. Carbon dioxide works at high pressures, requiring specialised equipment.But as many places phase down HFCs, alternative refrigerants will remain important.Ms Sachar says that we still need refrigerants because for home cooling, \"A/Cs as we know them today will continue to be the solution, at least for the next decade or so\".Tati van Thiel PhotographyLindsay Rasmussen says cooling without refrigerants will be \"revolutionary\"In the longer term, some scientists are looking toward cooling devices that don't need liquid refrigerants at all.Lindsay Rasmussen, who manages building and land-use projects at the energy non-profit RMI, calls these \"revolutionary technologies\".A major set of revolutionary cooling tech is solid-state cooling. This uses solid materials and some sort of additional force to induce temperature changes. That extra force could be pressure, voltage, magnets or mechanical stress.Ms Rasmussen says that solid-state devices can go further than incremental improvements because \"not only do they eliminate those super-polluting refrigerants, but they can also offer improved efficiency to the systems\".RMI has identified between 10 and 20 start-ups working on early versions of solid-state cooling devices.One of those startups is the German company Magnotherm, which uses magnets. Certain materials change temperature when exposed to magnetic fields.\"With our technology, it's inherently safe because it's not toxic, it's a metal, and we operate at very low pressures,\" according to Timur Sirman, the CEO and cofounder of Magnotherm.The idea of magnetocaloric cooling has been around for years, but commercialising it is relatively new. Magnotherm has built about 40 beverage coolers, and about five refrigerators, in what is so far a manual and in-house process.The permanent magnets are the most expensive part of the technology, Mr Sirman reports. \"But it never breaks, so we can always reuse this quite cost-intensive component.\"The company is seeking out alternative sources of magnetic fields, as well as optimising materials, as they aim to dramatically increase the cooling capacity of their devices.Mr Sirman believes that if you account for the efficiency and health issues of refrigerants, like leakages, Magnotherm products can compete on price. \"We are not targeting customers who are only looking at initial cost.\"He acknowledges that for now the company's beverage coolers are quite pricey. Their customers tend to be early adopters of new technologies.PhononicPhonic's cooling systems are used to chill food without refrigerantsAnother technology under development is thermoelectric cooling.This involves moving heat between two sides of a device. With the application of electrical energy, heat is transferred in the direction of the current.A notable thermoelectric start-up is Phononic, which is based in the US and has an additional manufacturing facility in Thailand.Millions of Phononic cooling devices are now in use, including in data centres, supermarkets and other buildings.Their cooling devices are built in a similar way to computer chips, using semiconducting materials to transfer the heat.\"Our chips are really thin, really small, but they get really cold. They consume a small amount of electricity in generating that coldness, but they pack one hell of a punch,\" says Tony Atti, the CEO of Phononic.He says that, to work at their best, traditional fridges need to be run all the time.But  thermoelectric devices can be easily switched on off. This helps to reduce the costs, energy use and space requirements. \"We like to present the coolness on demand where you need it,\" says Mr Atti.  Another advantage is that thermoelectric cooling can operate silently. \"That's because there's zero moving parts,\" Ms Rasmussen explains. \"The heat is occurring because of the reaction in the material level.\"In contrast, standard vapour compression systems contain pumps, condensers and expanders for refrigerant, which all generate much of the noise.A different type of solid-state cooling is elastocaloric cooling. This achieves temperature changes through mechanical stress to elastocaloric materials, which can cool down or heat up with the application of stress.Researchers in four European countries are collaborating on SMACool, an elastocaloric air conditioner that uses metal tubes made from specific metallic alloys.At the moment, elastocaloric prototypes have much lower cooling capacity than commercial air conditioning. And the maximum possible efficiency of SMACool is still lower than that of conventional air conditioning, although the aim is to beat the energy efficiency of A/C.However, progress is continuing. A team led by Hong Kong researchers recently created an A/C alternative that achieved a cooling power of 1,284W—the first time an elastocaloric device surpassed the 1,000W mark. One innovation was using graphene nanofluid rather than distilled water to transfer the heat.Overall, Ms Rasmussen says, solid-state devices are generally not yet as powerful as conventional vapour-compression air conditioning. But she expects performance improvements over time.She also expects improvements in affordability. So far solid-state cooling has mainly been deployed in wealthy countries.A key question, Ms Rasmussen says, is \"Can these technologies scale up to where they could be affordable for those who need it the most and where the greatest demand for cooling is coming from?\"More Technology of BusinessWho will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?Do we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?The Finnish defence firms 'on steroids'International BusinessClimateTechnology of Business"

    "content": "The camera tech propelling shows like Adolescence15 May 2025ShareSaveChris BaraniukTechnology ReporterShareSaveNetflixIn Netflix's Adolescence the camera had to be attached to a drone while filmingThree strong knocks from the police battering ram and the front door bursts open. There's a lot of shouting.We follow heavily-armed officers as they stream into the house, a woman drops to the floor as the camera turns left, and we head up a small, dimly lit staircase, passing a man with his back against the wall, hands raised, yelling to no avail.Within moments, a 13-year-old boy has been arrested and we're back outside in the morning light. The family screams on the front lawn as the camera returns to the boy, now a detainee in the dark interior of a police van.All this happens in three minutes. In one take. It is an early scene in Netflix's hit show Adolescence, which was watched by more than 120 million people worldwide in its first month.It wouldn't have been possible to film a sequence quite like this five years ago, the show's cinematographer Matthew Lewis claimed in a recent interview. Each of the four, roughly one hour-long episodes of Adolescence was shot entirely in one take, known as a \"oner\", with the camera frequently following characters through frantic scenes, or switching from handheld to vehicle-mounted filming.DJILightweight but adaptable cameras give filmmakers huge flexibilityLightweight, self-stabilising cameras that can adjust to dramatic changes in environmental lighting have sparked a small revolution in the film and TV industry.At the end of Adolescence's second episode, for instance, the camera moves from filming inside a car to crossing a road, to flying over nearby streets, and then to ground level again.You can just about detect the switch from drone to human operator – there's a minuscule wobble – but unless you're looking for them, these transitions are effectively seamless.It was made possible in part by a DJI Ronin 4D, a small, high-resolution camera that has multiple built-in sensors for detecting movement in relation to the floor and nearby objects.This allows internal mechanisms to compensate for that movement and achieve smooth, stable footage.The result is \"phenomenal\", says seasoned filmmaker and Boston University professor Tim Palmer.He initially doubted that episodes of Adolescence really were shot in a single take. \"As soon as I saw it I knew, no, that was absolutely done in one take.\"Camera technology has developed significantly lately, he adds.In 2014, Prof Palmer worked on a hospital drama called Critical, which required lengthy shots in busy hospital corridors. \"It was just little joystick video game controllers to make the camera pan and tilt, and that was just not precise enough,\" he recalls.Makers of such TV programmes have long tried to capture the energy of hospital environments. One episode of 1990s BBC series Cardiac Arrest opens in a hectic triaging unit. As far as I can tell, there is only one cut in the first 10 minutes – but the camera moves rather robotically back and forth. It is nowhere near as dynamic as Adolescence.Prof Palmer adds that gimbals, stabilising devices for cameras, have been around for years now, but methods of controlling them and pulling footage remotely have only recently become highly sophisticated.He also mentions how some of the latest cameras have built-in filters that can be controlled remotely, or stabilisation technology that can be activated or deactivated at the press of a button. \"That's a complete game-changer,\" he says.Ray BurmistonFilmmaker Tim Palmer says the impact of new cameras is \"phenomenal\"Long single takes are far from a new concept in cinema. There are examples dating back decades.Take the 2015 film Victoria, a hair-raising, two-hour and 20 minute feature film that its makers say was shot in a single take. Some have expressed scepticism about this in the past, but cinematographer Sturla Brandth Grøvlen tells the BBC emphatically, \"There are no edits or cuts.\"While Mr Brandth Grøvlen had to rely on the technology of the time, he says that the slightly shaky images were intentional – the director wanted a film that reminded viewers of footage shot by news crews in warzones.\"It feels very much in the moment, but also like you never know what's going to happen,\" says Mr Brandth Grøvlen, \"You're taken on a journey.\"He used a Canon C300, a small motion picture camera well-suited to documentary filmmaking. Mr Brandth Grøvlen reduced the weight of the camera as much as possible by only adding essential accessories. He also practised the movements he planned to make during takes of the final film in order to achieve \"muscle memory\" of the process.\"When they suddenly start running I have to shift my grip on the camera from holding it on the side handle to the top handle – that way it shakes a little bit less,\" he explains.The Ronin 4D is DJI's \"first dedicated cinema camera\", says Brett Halladay, product education manager at the firm.He describes the extensive stabilisation technology and the fact that the device transmits footage wirelessly to on-set monitors. It automatically selects a frequency based on the best available signal.There are some limitations, though. The camera is not set up for vertical filming – increasingly in-demand with the rise of video-sharing smartphone apps such as TikTok.Mr Halladay points out that it is possible to shoot in landscape and crop to a portrait, or vertical, image, though that might not be the most \"ideal\" solution, he acknowledges.Other cameras are available. Canon, for instance, touts its line of lightweight Cinema EOS models.Barry Griffin, a manager at Canon, says these cameras are finding a market among filmmakers aiming to shoot with increased freedom, or who want to put cameras in tiny podcast studios and livestream high-quality shots of hosts and their guests.CanonCanon says its lightweight EOS range of cameras is finding new marketsThe rise of highly ergonomic cameras could have a big impact on the quality of film and TV, says Booker T Mattison, a screenwriter and director who teaches filmmaking at the University of Georgia. \"Point of view is often represented by the camera itself,\" he says. \"It absolutely, 100% allows you to tell better, more dynamic stories.\"There's a risk that obsessing over one-take TV shows could become a gimmick at the expense of good storytelling, says Carey Duffy, director of product experiences at Cooke Optics.Lightweight Cooke lenses were used by the makers of Adolescence. Mr Duffy explains that his firm designed these lenses to work with emerging, lightweight cameras and that this was possible in part because of the shorter distance between the back of the lens and the image sensor in those cameras, versus earlier devices.But fascination over \"oners\" won't be enough to retain audiences, says Prof Palmer: \"Personally, it's not going to make me want to watch something because it's shot it one take – I want to watch these things because they're good.\"More Technology of BusinessDo we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?A revolution is under way in India's trainer industryThe Finnish defence firms 'on steroids'FilmmakingTechnology of BusinessInternational businessTechnology"

    "content": "How to avoid a puncture on the Moon12 May 2025ShareSavePadraig BeltonTechnology ReporterShareSaveGetty ImagesThe Apollo mission lunar rovers were lightweight vehiclesGoing back to the Moon after half a century, and then to Mars, literally means reinventing the wheel.After all, Mars is a long way to come back if you get a flat.\"One thing you cannot have is a puncture,\" says Florent Menegaux, chief executive of the French tyre-maker Michelin.The tough conditions on Mars have been underlined by the experience of the unmanned Curiosity rover.Just a year after landing in 2012, its six rigid aluminium tyres were visibly ripped through with punctures and tears.As for the Moon, the US Artemis missions aim to return astronauts there, perhaps by 2027.Later Artemis missions plan to use a lunar rover to explore the Moon's south pole starting with Artemis V, currently scheduled for 2030.The Artemis astronauts will be driving much further than their Apollo forebears, who in six landings between 1969 and 1972 never ventured more than 25 miles (40km) across the Moon's surface.\"The target is to cover 10,000 kilometres in 10 years,\" says Sylvain Barthet, who runs Michelin's lunar airless wheel programme in the central French town of Clermont Ferrand.\"We're not talking about short, week-long durations, we're talking about decades of utilisation,\" says Dr Santo Padula, who has a PhD in materials science, and works for Nasa as an engineer at the John Glenn Research Centre in Cleveland, Ohio.NASAThe rocky surface on Mars has damaged Curiosity's tyresOne big challenge for anyone developing technology for the Moon are the huge temperature ranges.At the lunar poles temperatures can plunge lower than -230C, that's not far off absolute zero, where atoms stop moving. And that's a problem for tyres.\"Without atom motion you have a hard time having the material be able to deform and return,\" says Dr Padula.The tyres need to be able to deform as they go over rocks and then ping back to their original shape.\"If we permanently deform a tyre, it doesn't roll efficiently, and we have issues with power loss,\" says Dr Padula.The new wheels will also carry much bigger loads than the lightweight rovers Apollo astronauts cruised around in.The next space missions will need to drive round \"bigger science platforms and mobile habitats that get larger and larger\", he says.And that will be an even heftier problem on Mars, where gravity is double that on the Moon. Padraig BeltonMichelin uses high-performance plastics for its Moon tyresApollo's lunar rovers used tyres made from zinc-coated piano wire in a woven mesh, with a range of around 21 miles.Since extreme temperatures and cosmic rays break down rubber or turn it to a brittle glass, metal alloys and high-performance plastic are chief contenders for airless space tyres.\"In general, metallic or carbon fibre-based materials are used for these wheels,\" says Pietro Baglion, team leader of the European Space Agency's (ESA) Rosalind Franklin Mission, which aims to send its own rover to Mars by 2028.One promising material is nitinol, an alloy of nickel and titanium.\"Fuse these and it makes a rubber-acting metal that can bend all these different ways, and it will always stretch back to its original shape, says Earl Patrick Cole, chief executive of The Smart Tire Company.He calls nitinol's flexible properties \"one of the craziest things you will ever see\".Nitinol is a potentially \"revolutionary\" material says Dr Padula, because the alloy also absorbs and releases energy as it changes states. It may even have solutions to heating and refrigeration, he says.However, Mr Barthet at Michelin thinks that a material closer to a high-performance plastic will be more suitable for tyres that need to cover long distances on the Moon. BridgestoneThe pads on the Bridgestone tyre mimic camel hoovesBridgestone has meanwhile taken a bio-mimicry approach, by making a model of the footpads of camels.Camels have soft, fatty footpads that disperse their weight on to a wider surface area, keeping their feet from sinking into loose sandy soil.Inspired by that, Bridgestone is using a felt-like material for its tread, while the wheel comprises thin metal spokes that can flex.The flexing divides the lunar module's weight into a larger contact area, so it can drive without getting stuck in the fragments of rock and dust on the Moon's surface.Michelin and Bridgestone are each part of different consortiums that, along with California's Venturi Astrolab, are presenting their proposed tyre tech to Nasa at the John Glenn Centre this month (May).Nasa is expected to make a decision later this year - it might choose one proposal or adopt elements of several of them.Meanwhile, Michelin is testing its tyres by driving a sample rover around on a volcano near Clermont, whose powdery terrain resembles the Moon's surface.Bridgestone is doing the same on western Japan's Tottori Sand Dunes.ESA is also exploring the possibility of whether Europe might make a rover on its own for other missions, says Mr Barthet.The work might have some useful applications here on Earth.While working on his doctorate at the University of Southern California, Dr Cole joined a Nasa entrepreneurial programme to work on commercialising some of the technology from the Mars super-elastic rover tyre.An early product this year will be nickel-titanium bicycle tyres.Priced around $150 (£120) each, the tyres are much more expensive than regular ones, but would be extremely durable. He also plans to work this year on durable tyres for motorbikes, aimed at areas with rough roads. For all this, his \"dream\" remains to play a part in humanity's return to the Moon.\"So, I can tell my kids, look up there on the Moon,\" he says. \"Daddy's tyres are up there.\"More Technology of BusinessWho will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?Do we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?Finland's bid to win Europe's start-up crownNasaThe MoonSpace explorationTechnology of BusinessInternational business"

That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.The Arctic World Archive is in an disused coal mine near LongyearbyenThe AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.The software developer has archived hundreds of reels of open source code here, which are the building blocks underpinning computer operating systems, software, websites and apps.Programming languages, AI tools, and every active public repository on its platform, written by its 150 million users, are also stored here.\"It's incredibly important for humanity to secure the future of software, it's become so critical to our day to day lives,\" Githhub's chief operating officer, Kyle Daigle tells the BBC.His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"The film is stored in metallic envelopes in the underground vaultAt Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev. \"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.Clients pay to have their data transferred to tape and stored in the ArcticEvery day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.Many firms offer long-term data storage.Cassettes of magnetic tape known as LTO (Linear Tape Open), are the most common form, but newer innovations promise to revolutionise how we preserve information.For example, Microsoft's Project Silica has developed 2mm-thick panes of glass, onto which chunks of data is transferred by powerful lasers.Meanwhile a team of scientists from the University of Southhampton have created a so-called 5D memory crystal, which has saved a record of the human genome.That's also been placed in the Memory of Mankind repository, another vault safeguarding historic documents, hidden in a salt mine in Austria.The film contains instructions on how to read the dataThe Arctic World Archive receives deposits three times a year, and as the BBC visited, recordings of endangered languages and the manuscripts of the composer Chopin, were among the latest reels placed in the vault.Photographer, Christian Clauwers, who's been documenting South Pacific Islands threatened by sea level rise, was also adding his work.\"I deposited footage and photography, visual witnesses of the Marshall Islands,\" he says.\"The highest point of the island is three meters, and they're facing huge impact of climate change.\"\"It was really humbling and surreal,\" says archivist Joanne Shortland, head of Heritage Collections at the Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust, after depositing records, engineers' drawings and photographs of historic car models.\"I have all these formats that are becoming obsolete.\"You need to keep changing the file format and making sure that it's accessible in 20 or 30, years time.

These systems are notorious for happening at night time when you can't see what's going on, so you do feel like their eyes and ears,\" says Mr Brown.Mr Brown's active, highly engaged Facebook audience is indicative of how more members of the public are turning to social media for news and weather updates - in the US, it's how 20% of adults get this information, according to Pew Research Centre.People pay as much attention to influencers on Facebook as they do journalists and the mainstream media, and actually pay more attention to them than their mainstream counterparts on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, according to a study by the Reuters Institute and University of Oxford.Prof Daniel Angus is director of the Digital Media Research Centre at Queensland University of Technology.When Brisbane-based Prof Angus found himself caught up in the heavy rain and flooding brought on by Tropical Cyclone Alfred also in February, he preferred to follow official advice from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, as he believes they still provide the most accurate forecasts and warnings.Prof Angus recognises the rising popularity of weather influencers like Mr Brown's Wally's Weather as stemming from not just a broader trend of public mistrust towards mainstream media and government sources, but about filling gaps in coverage and relatability.\"Weather influencers have gained popularity, particularly in rural and regional areas, because they provide highly localised, real-time updates that mainstream media can often overlook,\" says Prof Angus.\"They engage directly with their audience, offering personalised analysis and responding to community concerns in a way that traditional news outlets typically don't.\"Their credibility has grown because they are seen as passionate, knowledgeable, and often deeply embedded in the communities they report on.\"Queensland University of TechnologyWeather influencers are part of the \"attention economy\" says Daniel AngusYet the issue with weather influencers, Prof Angus notes, is their tendency to scaremonger, as social media weather forecaster Higgins Storm Chasing, also based in Townsville, has been criticised for.In 2018, it was criticised for predicting historic levels of rainfall and flooding to its one million Facebook followers, which didn't materialise.Higgins Storm Chasing, which has hired professional meteorologist and amateur tornado chaser Thomas Hinterdorfer, didn't respond to the BBC's request for an interview.\"Weather influencers are often prone to hyperbolic and exaggerated claims, as they are not held to the same standards or consequences as their mainstream and official government counterparts, which has led to claims of scaremongering, and propagation of misinformation,\" explains Prof Angus.\"What we have to understand is that they are part of an attention economy. The more eyes they have, the more engagement they see on their metrics. The bureau and governments are very reserved in putting out alerts and evacuation orders, because it only takes a few non-events for people to lose their trust in them,\" says Professor Angus.\"They have to answer for that, whereas for Higgins or any of the others, there's ultimately zero accountability if they completely mess it up. \"Alan SeallsAlan Sealls warns against the accuracy of long-range weather forecastsIt's a view shared by Alan Sealls, a former TV weatherman who now teaches meteorology at the University of South Alabama, and consults as a forensic meteorologist, providing weather analysis for legal cases.Prof Sealls is also now the president elect of the American Meteorological Society (AMS), which welcomes both professionally-trained meteorologists and weather influencers as members, so doesn't have an official position on the topic.But Prof Sealls' personal view is that trained meteorologists with an online platform add value, while those without formal training stand to discredit the profession.\"There are those who are not formally-trained and take more risks in showing and promoting long-range weather outlooks, as though they are as accurate as short-range forecasts, particularly when the outlook hints at extreme weather. That's considered hype that makes people click and share, increasing the popularity of the influencer,\" he says.\"Trained meteorologists avoid that because it causes confusion in implying something distant is likely, when in reality it is uncertain and unknown.\"On the other hand, there are weather influencers who have the equipment and expertise to track and forecast local weather when it is extreme, in times of crisis, often giving more focus to communities that don't get full coverage from traditional TV stations. \"While Andrew Brown of Wally's Weather is self taught in meteorology, he has a masters in IT and numerous other technology qualifications.His investment in forecasting equipment has been so big that he introduced paid subscriptions three years ago, but they mainly just cover his costs.The advancement of AI, he says, gives him more time to accurately analyse data and communicate it to his followers. It will also allow him to expand to an Australia-wide operation.Yet there is money to be made in the world of weather influencing. Colorado-based Andrew Markowitz has a meteorology degree and works full-time for an energy company, but also has 135,000 followers on a TikTok weather page.Through a combination of live stream donations, sponsorships, brand deals, and TikTok's Creativity Program which helps creators monetise their content, Mr Markowitz says he can earn up to thousands of dollars a month.\"It's definitely not enough to quit my job, nor would I want to. I just treat it as fun money on the side, which I usually spend on travels,\" says Mr Markowitz.Back in Australia, Mr Brown says he would like to retire from teaching, and have more time to focus on Wally's Weather, and to spend with his grandchildren, but acknowledges that this is a while away. But what he doesn't want is to be the face of the page - something he's so far avoided.\"I don't go out of my way to reveal who I am, because I like to be able to walk down the street and not be harassed. I've been interviewed on the radio before, and then walked past the person, and they had no idea it was me,\" says Mr Brown.\"Sometimes I can stand in line and hear people talking about the page, and they have no idea that I'm right there. It all adds to the fun.\"More Technology of BusinessWho will win the race to develop a humanoid robot?Do we need cocoa-free chocolate and is it nice?The Finnish defence firms 'on steroids'MeteorologyInternational BusinessWeather forecastingTechnology of Business"
